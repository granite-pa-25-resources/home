# Granite School District Area 5 Study - Independent Analysis

An independent, data-driven analysis of the Granite School District's Area 5 Population Analysis Study and proposed school closures for the 2025-2026 school year.

## üéØ Key Findings

### Critical Methodological Flaw
The study uses **in-boundary resident population forecasts** to justify closures, but schools actually operate on **total enrollment** (which includes choice-based, out-of-boundary students). This creates a 50-80% discrepancy at several schools:

- **Morningside:** 309 boundary residents vs 561 total students (+82%)
- **Penn:** 344 boundary residents vs 606 total students (+76%)
- **Eastwood:** 173 boundary residents vs 267 total students (+54%)

### Goal Misalignment
The district's stated goal is to achieve **500-550 students per school**. The PAC recommendations result in only **466 students per school** - falling short by 34-84 students.

### Transparency Excellence
The district earns an **A+** for transparency:
- 11+ video recordings of public meetings on YouTube
- Individual student mobility data tables for each school
- 40-member community subcommittee
- AI-summarized community feedback
- Multiple feedback mechanisms

### Overall Assessment: **B-** (Good Process, Flawed Methodology)

## üìä Key Visualizations

### 1. Normalized Total Enrollment (2021 = 100%)
Shows how actual enrollment changed 2021-2025:
- Penn grew to 106% (gaining students)
- Oakridge fell to 73% (losing students rapidly)
- Morningside stable at 99-100%

### 2. Normalized In-Boundary Population (2021 = 100%)
Shows how boundary populations changed:
- Cottonwood fell to 80% (steepest decline)
- Most schools declining 10-20%
- Eastwood had volatile swings

### 3. Total vs Boundary Comparison
Overlays both metrics for key schools, revealing the massive gap between what the district measures (boundary) and what matters (total enrollment).

## ‚ùì Questions for Public Hearings

Key questions community members should ask (Nov 18, Dec 2 at 7:00 PM):

1. Why is there such a large gap between in-boundary population and total enrollment? Where are out-of-boundary students coming from?

2. What analysis predicts whether Eastwood's 94 out-of-boundary students will transfer to Oakridge or leave the district?

3. Morningside has 561 students‚Äîwhy is it treated as underenrolled?

4. Why not close Cottonwood (steepest decline -42%) instead of Eastwood?

5. How much does closing one school save annually? What are one-time closure costs?
