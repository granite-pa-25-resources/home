Skyline High",Skyline,"As a 4th grade ALC parent at Morningside, many of our students just switched into Morningside at the beginning of 3rd grade when ALC starts as a cohort. If the current 3rd and 4th grade ALC students at Morningside are forced to move for next school year, these students will have been moved through at least 3 elementary schools in their k-5 experience. Given we know these students thrive in consistent environments, I urge the PAC and board to allow the current 3rd and 4th grade Morningside ALC students to remain at Morningside through the end of their 5th grade year (so all would be completed by May 2028), which also gives Morningside time to build up attendance with DLI French expansion. Students starting ALC in Fall 2026 (starting 3rd grade in fall 2026) could be moved to wherever the ALC program is housed. I agree that Woodstock poses logistical challenges for us with start and end times as per the ALC parent document we have submitted and this needs to be considered as a parent juggling students across multiple schools and programs."

Olympus High",Olympus,"My first question and concern with the PAC study referenced our care and concern for neurodivergent populations. In referencing testing scores, gifted students are represented only as high-performers when in actuality “gifted” generally refers to children who are twice exceptional. These students may not hit that “top 5%”, and are always best served in gifted programs. Where is  the BEST INTEREST of our  NEURODIVERGENT students when collapsing Accelerated Learning Programs? As a parent of a child who was not being served at our “home” school, we found Morningside to be actually interested in helping my son. It was a completely different experience because teacher, aids, social workers, admin were all on board and so much more familiar with neurodivergent students. It was a mind-blowing difference. Where my child fit into that top percentage I could not say. I can say that he has thrived, THRIVED in the ALP. He would never be where he is now - Wasatch Jr GTs, without his Morningside experience."

If they have a great culture and test scores with the top 9% instead of just the top 5%, why not keep it with the top 9%? When will a bus schedule be provided for ALC students that are in the Morningside or Upland Boundary? Why is the school starting so early, as it overlaps with the Jr. High and High School. Why is the ALC being located at an extremity instead of centrally? "
9/11/2025 19:18:53,,,,"It seems like you can’t do basic math—or don’t want to so you can “hide” data to bolster something you’ve already decided on. Why are you using percentages to make admissions for ALC? If 10 kids score 99.(xx), but only 1 can get in because you’re only taking the top 5% how is that at all fair? The students are succeeding and doing well but you’re actually excluding most of them because you’re using percentages. You’re creating a caste system. Shame on you. "

Morningside El,Olympus,"We have three ‘graduates’ from the Morningside ALC program, and it has been critical in meeting each of their individual needs in very different needs. The experience and training of the incredible teachers has made it possible for them to gain confidence and thrive in middle and high school, and one of our children would have struggled socially in a traditional classroom. 

With a current first grader, we are in a difficult bind as she could end up at THREE different schools in three years-(Morningside ALC first, Woodstock second, and if she doesn’t test in for third grade we would have to find another school at that time). 

If keeping the ALC at Morningside is not feasible, please consider removing the requirement for this first grade cohort to retest and allowing them to move to Woodstock next year and stay in the ALC through fifth grade. Without this modification to the current recommendations, remaining in GSD is not a tenable option for our daughter and family. "
9/11/2025 20:07:16,,,,The score spread of ALC students is not provided. Calculations CAN be made based on more than just percentages. Most state agencies use more than just percentages to calculate things like budget or admissions. If you have 10 kids score high and reject part of them because of percentages that DOES NOT mean that they don’t need high-achieving support. You’re just blindly arguing half of them are not worthy.

Morningside El,Skyline,"My name is [name removed] and I have three children that will be in elementary school next year.  As parents, we donate significant time and money to Morningside.  Our oldest is in the ALC program at Morningside in 3rd grade.  She has had a wonderful experience.  We are hoping that our other two children will also test into the ALC experience in the next 2 years.  We value ALC because of the extra educational rigor this program requires.  

We believe the ALC option should be expanded rather than shrunk.  More children need a more rigorous educational experience, with higher expectations.  We are saddened to hear that Granite School District is considering shrinking the number of students who have the option for this program.  We ask that you please reconsider how this program might be expanded.  

In addition, it would help us and many of our neighbors if the ALC program could continue to be located in Area 5, at Upland, Driggs, or Oakridge, for example.  That makes neighborhood friendships and travel logistics much easier.

If needed, we may be open to donating additional resources to help expand ALC and keep it in Area 5.

We look forward to hearing from you. .

Morningside El,Skyline,"Why would the District be looking to reduce/shrink the ALC program that is working really well (from parents and teachers’ perspectives), has been carefully crafted and maintained by some very good teachers, and doesn't (seem to) consume extra resources?

Our child is thriving in Morningside ALC, and we have 2 more children we want to benefit from the program.

If it moves to Woodstock, our most likely choice will be to do regular classes at Upland.  Reducing ALC numbers means we cannot depend on our other 2 being accepted into the program.  And the logistics of having our kids at multiple schools spread out is difficult.

Please reconsider expanding ALC and keep the Morningside ALC teachers together at an Area 5 school.  Please keep a really good program going."
9/12/2025 20:58:39,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,"Thank you to the Board, PAC, and district curriculum folks for meeting with the ALC parents last night. Perhaps it was the expected outcome, but it seems that most parents left feeling more frustrated last night, not less, and that their concerns and requests for data are not being adequately heard or addressed. I will summarize my key concerns and unanswered questions.

1) The only reason we have been given for why the ALC on the east side needs to be halved over the next 1-2 years is this arbitrary ""5%"" number and to be proportional with West side schools. ""Top 5%"" on CogAT is not a national standard, a Utah State Board of Education recommendation, nor a GSD policy (at least not one that has been provided to parents). This threshold does not define giftedness. 

GSD Continuum of services - there is significant concern that cutting ALC (tier 5) will leave no practical support for children removed from the ALC in this manner - there is no tier 4 support in elementary, and tier 3 support is plagued by significant variation between schools and a lack of classroom support for clusters. It is unclear how GSD will meet their commitment that all children have a right to have the opportunity to make at least one year of academic growth during a school year.

We understand that the nature of forming classes means that a CogAT threshold score may not be feasible - but it is unfair to use this neighborhood 5% score as a hard cut off or to use it as a tool to cut the program. If 60 kids are top scorers using raw scores, universal scale scores or standard age scores on the CogAT but there are only 30 spots, then GSD will call 30 of those kids ""gifted"" and 30 not. It sounds like the district has not evaluated actual scores for the ALCs and understanding this data is key to understand whether there are ""too many"" kids benefiting from this program. It would be similarly silly to say that a high schooler with a 34 on the ACT or a 1500 on the SAT would not thrive at an Ivy League school just because others in their neighborhood scored higher. 

This East side - West side comparison that has repeatedly come up unhelpfully pits the two sides against each other in an unfair way. Without real programmatic data you cannot argue that the East side has proportionally more, therefore it needs to be cut. Why not expand the ALC into more schools on the west side instead? You do not improve equity between a short person and a tall person by cutting the legs off at the knees of the tall person - you give the short person the necessary resources to have the same view.

2) No evidence of harm having up to 10% or even 20% of kids in these ALC classes - perhaps ALC should be expanded and marketed to out of district kids. If a 5% threshold is not evidence-based in either the literature or from GSD data demonstrating poor outcomes it would be silly to cut a popular and successful program based on an arbitrary number.
 
The Board asked PAC for more information on this issue during the Sept 2nd Board meeting and the PAC assured us that they would ""bring the data"" to the ALC families. As you know, they did not last night. The only additional data that they provided was a pie chart of one 3rd grade class, and no evidence that having the top 9% of kids in a class is somehow bad. Please share data on outcomes of children over the multiple decades of the program - are the top 2% of kids (on one standardized test) somehow being harmed by having to associate with kids who are the top 10% instead? Are the top 10% not reaching their potential? What might be the harm to these children if access to this program is taken away?

3) If a study on ALC is needed, let's study it. Please take the time to understand the data and identify appropriate locations for programming before making a decision. This may need longer than the 2025 boundary study allows.  As part of a study, let's explore what options there might be to market and grow the program with students from other districts. It was clear from the PAC and curriculum department's inability to answer any questions related to data that a more thorough study is needed. The current strategy of cutting the ALC feels more like a response to not knowing where to put it, rather than a true evaluation of the merits, benefits, and impact of the program.

After a proper study of the ALC program, if it's clear that we have ""too many"" gifted and high achieving kids and that students are being harmed by this, and GSD has committed to a 5% rule - reducing the ALC to one largely inaccessible location on the east side will not solve your 5% problem.

Has an analysis been done on why some kids in the top 5% do not choose to go to the ALC? From parents that I have talked to that have opted out, it's usually that they prefer their neighborhood school (walkability, schedules, or friends) and cannot justify the inconvenience of moving to another school. Moving the ALC to only Woodstock makes the ALC inaccessible (hello from Emigration). An inaccessible program is not going to make it more likely that the top 5% will choose to go - the same ""problem"" will be exacerbated as top students will be unable to attend due to distance, schedules, and split families. This location creates a barrier to equal education for ALC students.

To reiterate for those in the back - the main reason we have been provided for cutting ALC in half on the east side is this 5% threshold, but locating the program in a very inconvenient and logistically impossible location for many families will not make it more likely the top 5% will attend.

4) I am concerned about the many misconceptions of ALC and gifted & talented programming that I have heard from the PAC and even from the Board. It appears to me that many involved do not understand the program, its outcomes, impact, or frankly why gifted programming is something GSD has committed to. Some of the language used has directly or indirectly alluded to the following:  All children are gifted/talented,  Gifted and talented programs are ""elitist"",  Gifted and talented children do not need special programming,  Gifted students are just high achievers because they come from good social backgrounds/engaged parents,  Early years IB programming is a good alternative option for gifted students.

I truly hope that if any of the above are an opinion that you hold that you will take the necessary time to learn more about gifted and talented children and programming. The Utah State Board of Education handbook is a great place to start as all of the above are addressed in the ""typical misconceptions about gifted and talented learners"" on pages 17-19, but you will need to explore more for elaboration. Your current ALC teachers at Morningside, Woodstock, or across the district would also be an excellent place to learn more, as well as the NAGC. This program, which is a ""need"", is being proposed to be sacrificed for elective program ""wants"". 

5) Some of the French DLI reasoning is based on more hope than logic. Someone last night leaked that they expect the Butler French DLI just to the south of Morningside to close - Butler denies this, their DLI enrollment is full, and it is not part of the Canyons school district 2025 study. There has been no real projections of who these students are that are going to fill this school or where they come from. PAC has repeatedly tried to use the Spanish ALC as a comparator, which frankly does not make sense given the number of native Spanish speakers in Utah and the social benefits of Spanish.


I know this was long, but I truly hope you have made it this far and considered it. I want to end on a somewhat emotional plea. My daughter is in the first grade ALC. All through Kindergarten at Eastwood she had no real friends - no playdate invitations and no one she closely connected with. In the second week of being in the ALC I heard for the very first time ""Mama I made a friend today"". The benefits of ALC go so far beyond testing. But now that she is thriving in this program our choice is a 3rd school in 3 years with an extra 40 minutes of commuting a day (""it's just an extra 10 minutes away!"" PAC says - but that is x4 trips a day), making our total commute time to-from our Emigration home 2x/day to be over 2.5 hours every day just for elementary school. And even if we committed to that, she might test out at the end of next year since there will be fewer slots sending her to a 4th new school in 4 years, for someone whose giftedness means she also struggles to make friends.

Please reconsider the proposal to limit this program and limit access to it. The children need it."
9/12/2025 23:22:16,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Olympus,"I was able to attend the ALC meeting at Morningside on Thursday evening (9/12), and appreciated the time taken by the Granite School District staff and school board (full representation) to be there.  There was a lot of healthy discussion, some answers provided, and some open questions remaining at the end.  I would like to summarize my reaction and open questions following that meeting.

My Initial Reaction to the Preliminary Recommendation (prior to meeting)
•        Most local residents are aware of the reduction in student population in this area and accept the stated goals of the effort—in summary: to increase utilization, reduce costs (overhead staff, buildings, etc.), and provide more flexibility at each school by having more classes at each grade.
•        Closing Eastwood would makes sense, based on its location, proximity to others, low student population in boundaries, age, etc.
•        Closing Morningside would make sense based on the same criteria (despite it being my student’s school, I can see the rationale.)
•        What doesn’t make sense is keeping Morningside open, anyway—that seems to overturn the majority of gains to be made by closing it as a boundary school.  You would still have all of the costs of keeping it open (leadership, staff, maintenance, utilities, bussing, etc), but now with only a 41% utilization.  That doesn’t achieve any of the stated goals.
•        It doesn’t make sense to move the ALC program all the way over to Woodstock.  Woodstock is the furthest southwest corner of the area.  It is not really central to anyone, as it is bordered by the Murray School district on the west, and the Canyons District to the south.  It is so far away from current program participants that it would not be conducive to many, if not most, of the current participating students.  [Turns out that this may be intentional].  And, it comes with new costs that did not exist before: longer more expensive bussing, portable classrooms. [Turns out that this may be intentional].


Surprise Learnings at the Meeting:
•        District clarified that the ALC program moving to Woodstock, is not really a “move”, as there will not be two classes there, and the teachers will not migrate, but rather this is an intentional consolidation and reduction in program size and participation.
•        The district is intentionally trying to reduce the participation rate such that the ALC class represents only 5% of the students from the area schools.  Apparently right now it is at about 9% in this area. 
•        The district acknowledged that in moving the program as far away as Woodstock, they expect that many will voluntarily withdraw, and it seems that was part of the calculus.
•        Several times the 5% number was referenced as a target participation rate.  However, the district site itself reads the top “5-10%” of students would qualify for ALC.
•        The district acknowledged that the goal for the DLI French program remaining at an open Morningside, would be to attract additional students from outside the district so that they can claim additional state funds for those students.
•        The district gave the facility quality of Woodstock as a primary reason for the choice of the location to host the ALC program.  However, at the same time they acknowledged that the school will be overpopulated for at least the next several years and will require additional portable classrooms to be brought in.
•        None of the current teachers in either program (Morningside or Woodstock) were consulted.
•        A study of the ALC program itself was not done in any way, other than just the noted 9% participation rate.


Post Meeting Thoughts and Questions:
•        The effective “closure” of the ALC program was not clearly communicated by the district, or even part of the initial stated goals.  It seemed like a blindside.  It makes sense to review programs at the same time as boundaries, so that accommodating changes can be made at the same time, but nowhere was it stated that program options would be intentionally designed out existence… especially when there is ZERO financial savings, and it may actually cost MORE.  This accomplishes none of the stated study goals.
•        Hosting the program at Woodstock is detrimental to both schools, both populations and unnecessarily disruptive to all involved.
o        This isn’t just move over to the school next door, as the boundaries have changed, but for many students in my area (near Rosecrest), 15-20 min drive each way, twice a day.   Parents doing that drive are looking at 1-1.5 hours in the car every day!
o        A bus with stops may take 35-45 min each way, would require students to be sitting on a bus for to 1-1.5 hours per day.
o        Many of the students in the program currently participate in before or after school extracurricular opportunities (choir, band, orchestra, art, STEM, reading clubs), requiring that they cannot take the bus for at least one direction—limiting students’ opportunity to participate when a parent isn’t available to drive them or pick them up, and it isn’t feasible for any of them to walk or ride a bike.
o        Adding the Morningside students to the current program at Woodstock, without knowing anything about the program other than that it is already populated, will have detrimental effects on that school as well.
        It will for several years over-populate the program, leading to very large class sizes
        For those going into 3rd grade it would limit opportunities for some existing students to continue in the program as they are now competing against a larger pool.  In short, some current participants at Woodstock will be bumped by students from Morningside.
•        What is gained by this change?  Why do it?  Who does it benefit?
o        It doesn’t meet stated goals of the boundary study by not having any financial advantages, not increasing utilization, and not retiring aging buildings (thereby avoiding significant maintenance).
o        It comes with some minor increases in costs (bussing, portable classrooms)
o        It makes Morningside less efficient, and less utilized (from 87% to 41%)
o        What harm is caused by maintaining two separate ALC classes/locations?  There are no cost savings to getting rid of it.  There are no boundary advantages (its classrooms will incredibly just be empty).  It is popular and successful.  Changing it for the sake of change only has negative implications and ramification on families and students.  Who does it benefit? 
•        Have the implications of these changes been thoroughly reviewed with the data, given that they were not part included as part of the boundary study?
o        At least some, if not many, parents in the Morningside ALC program, that feel they are no longer being served by the district will look for other options, especially with the state voucher program now available to attend schools in other districts, private schools, etc. in the area (e.g., Canyon Rim Academy, Reid School, Highland Park, etc.).  This would actually reduce the state funds to the district and have an impact on the quality of programs for all students in the district.
o        French DLI program will likely lose more participants, by removing it from a shared boundary school with the ALC program, than it gains.  Many students have siblings in the program and that is a key consideration for their participation. 
o        Any additional French students from out of the district will not be enough to offset the cost of keeping Morningside open, as you would need 100+ additional students to get back to even the current utilization of the school and thus the same student to school overhead ratio.
•        I am aware of multiple organic conversations that included comments about splitting the district, similar to how Jordan district split, in order to feel that they were part of a district that served them and their needs.  I don’t think most prefer that outcome, but people do want to feel like their school district is serving them equitably, not punishing them, and they are not getting that.

Conclusion/Suggestions/Recommendations
•        Parents are feeling blind-sided by the program phase-out, as it was not part of the initial goals, and was never communicated to them prior to the meeting.  This should be met with additional data and deeper review of the program related changes and impacts
•        Ideally both programs should remain (Woodstock and the one from Morningside) as there are no clear, or communicated benefits to anyone by closing the Morningside program. There are many clear negative impacts to almost everyone.
•        If Morningside is going to be closed as a boundary school, it should probably be closed completely, in order to invest the millions of dollars it would require to keep open, to the students and programs the other schools in the area or the district.
•        As long as boundaries are all being changed, it could easily be accommodated to adjust the boundaries slightly at one of the other nearby schools (Upland Terrace, etc.) to accommodate the ALC program in a regionally central school.
•        The French program, drawing from the whole district, does not have as strong of a need to be geographically located.  It could also be relocated to another area school, and in particular, if you are trying to attract students from out of the district, Woodstock, or any other school bordering on other districts, could be a good choice.
•        I feel strongly that it is important to try to keep the kids and families of ALC students in the district and in the public education system (as opposed to losing them to private schools or other districts)—I hope that the decisions made will accomplish that.

9/15/2025 9:30:59,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,"Regarding Morningside moving to Woodstock:
---------

Per latest population tables:
https://www.graniteschools.org/planning/student-mobility-and-population-tables/

I spoke to a parent whose children were relocated last year to Woodstock.  Two other schools were closed and their students reassigned.  Their children are now in 32:1 student:teacher classrooms.  Accommodating the student increase required closure of half of the gym, dance room, art room, music room, and a STEM lab that was less than a year old and had cost thousands of dollars to set up.

In Granite's latest published data, Woodstock is at 576 students (and 578 in another document).  This is 120% of its enrollment capacity.  In a twist of irony, 120% overenrollment is highlighted green because low enrollment percentages are considered the main negative red point.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VN5hMa77JWQXG0LKioZqnTyOxSb8RUye/view
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FqJXU7idcX5fdjxbpS51Hs5E1oLQ4vFq/view

The numbers are very clear.  Woodstock is already not capable of supporting current student needs from the two schools that were already added, and can not accommodate another influx of ALC students and any additional non-ALC students (such as non-ALC sibling that follow).  In the words of current parents at Woodstock: 'Woodstock is just a learning catastrophe.'

---------
Regarding ALC Enrollment Numbers
---------

We need more data and clarification on the reported 20% student‑area enrollment for Woodstock and Morningside. Does this 20% represent only students scoring at or above the 95th percentile on the CogAT? Data showing Fox Hills and West Valley are also needed so we can make accurate comparisons.  Would the ALC students at each of these schools fall within the top 5–10% of the entire district? Granite and ALC program materials identify that range as their target population.

The goal of ALC should be to serve the top 5–10% of students by test performance, not simply the top 5–10% compared to peers within a specific geographic area. Because the CogAT is a nationally standardized test, placement decisions should be based on the thinking abilities and needs it identifies — not on how those needs compare to the immediate neighborhood.

It is entirely plausible that GSD Area 5 has a unique need for more ALC classes and schools than areas such as Fox Hills or West Valley. Decisions about the number and location of ALC programs should be driven by student need, not by district‑wide percentages or the number of feeder schools for each program."
9/15/2025 12:31:19,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,"According to the district's own ALC slideshow, they recognize that ""gifted learners have different learning needs compared with typical learners. Academic growth for these students CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED through differentiated educational services, opportunities."" Then we are shown that there is a ""continuum of severity for academic needs"" and that Granite School District has a ""continuum of services for gifted and talented students."" This chart shows 5 levels, with ALC being #5. Granite School District does NOT provide any services that fit under level 3 or 4. If the district believes this ""extra"" 5-9% children do not belong in ALC, then it stands to reason that these kids should be receiving ""level 4"" services, but Granite district does not actually have any of those. Look at level 3, those options aren't provided also. Level 2 includes cluster groups, which are not even guaranteed for those that qualify for the ALC program, so definitely won't be guaranteed for this 5-9% group. So many will be left with level 1. And honestly level 2 cluster groups really don't provide much for the students-- it's often extra worksheets, extra computer programs, extra reading time etc. These students will be able to meet the learning standard, but will not be provided with the challenging and engaging material that they will need. Their learning needs will not be met.

There is an extreme problem with the way that the students are placed in the ALC program. Since you are taking the top percentage of students locally, then that means a child could be classified as ""gifted"" if they live in one boundary and ""not gifted"" if they simply lived a street over in another boundary. This is the same child, with the same learning needs, but depending on where they live they may not get their needs met. This placement method isn't about providing appropriate services for children's needs. I'm assuming it is about class size and money. 

The district knows that gifted children NEED a particular set of services. But are now saying they will only provide that for the top 5% and everyone else on the continuum will not be provided with the proper level of services. ALL of our ALC teachers have expressed that there is no problem with having these ""extra"" kids in their class. But we were lied to you and said teachers were consulted-- not our ALC teachers who are the EXPERTS in this matter.

Many of our students are diagnosed as twice-exceptional (gifted+ADHD, gifted+Autism etc). Under the IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), these children are legally required to have a free and APPROPRIATE education. It is not appropriate to dump these kids in a traditional class with little to no extra accommodations. My child is gifted and has ADHD, I have not felt the need to pursue an IEP or 504 because our ALC teachers are so highly qualified that they know how to best support these students, that no extra accommodations have been necessary. My child is THRIVING in ALC, but would have a lot of behavior problems in a traditional class because his brain is moving millions of miles per minute, he has lots of questions, wants to know everything, and talks a lot. He has had no behavior issues in ALC because our ALC teachers know how to keep these students engaged and stimulated. It is a misconception that teaching gifted children is easy because they are smart and learn quickly. These kids need to be kept engaged and stimulated with a wide variety of supplemented material that these phenomenal teachers often have to create on their own to move at these students' pace. 

This is not even about my own children, my son is in 3rd grade ALC, he will be able to finish the ALC irregardless what happens. My other son is in traditional 1st grade and I feel that's the right place for him. My concern is for the ALC program being cut down, for these phenomenal ALC teachers, and for the many students who will not have their learning needs met. 

We were told by Mr. Hogan that the district ""feels"" that the French program is going to get large enough to fill the school. Is there any actual data to support this ""feeling,"" how long is the wait list for Morningside's French program? Hogan's only reasoning was because surrounding districts don't have French programs, but there's also a very good chance that they don't have French programs because there isn't a big enough want for French in those districts. On their website Morningside French is full, but the district's other French school is not, it says ""accepting all applications."" So we can't even fill up our other French program in the district. It seems like next year Morningside will still be costing money to run the school, but now the school will be about half capacity. Why are the ALC kids being kicked out with a school with space for us and moved to a school that is already over capacity as is? Then kids will be stuck in portables, instead of at Morningside that will have the space. 

ALC draws kids of different races, cultures, socioeconomic statuses, etc. The ALC program brings in the most diversity to our schools, why is our program being cut for the French program for out of district students? Seems like the money from out of district students is being put before the NEEDS of our in district/in boundary tax-paying students. We would not be able to afford a private school for our gifted student, but this program allowed him to get the services he needs. There is not a need for French where we live, maybe only for those families who can afford a lavish vacation to France. Once again, it looks like those with more money are being catered too so they get what they WANT and CHILDREN'S NEEDS are put last. French is a WANT, while the ALC program is a need."

Morningside El,Skyline,"We do not understand why the current ALC students are being moved to Woodstock rather than be allowed to finish out their program at Morningside. It is clear the district has not done its due diligence in studying the impact on ALC families and children in the boundary study. If the district decides to ignore the parents, students, and teachers affected by the change, we would like the district to provide busing to the ALC program from Emigration Canyon or somewhere north of I-80. Having to drive 20 minutes each way is difficult; extending that drive to 30 minutes each way will be impossible. We would also like the district to ensure that current aftercare providers, including the JCC, will drive down to Woodstock to transport kids to their regular aftercare to avoid further disruption to their routines. We would also love for the district to start responding to emails and phone calls rather than encouraging communication and then not reciprocating. "
9/16/2025 21:11:53,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Olympus,"1. Do you have hard data showing that the top 10-20% being in the program is harming it? Where is this 5% threshold coming from? In multiple places on the GSD website it reads “typically 5-10%”. The language and messaging is ambiguous and sending mixed signals regarding the top priorities of the ALC program. What is ALC trying to be? What are the main goals? 

1a. Please ask more ALC teachers their input on whether they feel the program, as is, is not providing the environment for the 5% to excel. This, of course, needs to be asked in a forum where they can be comfortable sharing their honest opinion. 

1b. Does it seem that the 6-10% (or 20% depending a varied of comments from the ALC Morningside meeting) are not benefitting from this teaching style and environment? That is certainly not what I am hearing or personally experiencing. 

2. When I was at the ALC meeting at Morningside last May, I was specifically assure that if Morningside was closed, the ALC program would be moved to a “neighborhood” school and that GSD had a long history of commitment to the ALC program and that the commitment remained (these assurances are the reason we switched schools for our daughter). 

3. I do not intend to threaten, but to provide perspective on this one…our family was so excited to find ALC as we felt it was our way to remain in and support the public school system in GSD (which has been a priority for my husband and me) because our daughter is absolutely thriving in this program. She comes home talking about science projects and wants to read for multiple hours and tells us stories about what she is learning throughout the day as opposed to last year when we basically got no information from her about school besides drama on the playground. Given this (and now that we truly know how much she loves to learn and how much the environment matters) we will very strongly consider other districts, charter school or private school (and apply for UFA funds) if ALC is reduced and/or moved to a school that feeds into a different middle school and high school than we have planned on for our family as this removed from our community for years to come. I understand that we could still choose to bring our kids back to a middle school closer to home, but that fragments this group of kids at every step. 

4. This is anecdotal, but I feel that unless much more research has been done than has been shared with us (that supports why reducing/consolidating the program is recommended), reducing the ALC program is a rash decision and I truly feel if the district studied it and brought more attention to it, it could be an even bigger draw to GSD for other families. I would argue that study may just as easily lead to a recommendation to leave the program at the same size or even expand it as I think even more kids would thrive in this program if given the opportunity. I think it is also worth having as a part of the study the retest in 2nd grade for grades 3-5 as it seems like that is a pain point that is worthy of evaluating. 

5. To my understanding, Woodstock is already quite full and I’m not confident moving my oldest there with the risk that the program may be reduced in size and that my youngest may not be able to attend the same school. The sibling relationship and them being at the same school is very important to me. Maybe it’s too much to ask, but also important to me is the option to have, in one school, multiple tracks that may better suit the specific needs of either of my children. As we all know kids can be so different and I do not assume that AlC will be the best fit for both of my children (although with the amazing quality of the education my 2nd grader has received so far in the program, I certainly hope the program remains and my youngest tests in).

Morningside El,Olympus,"The ALC program has been amazing for my 3 kids and has provided the learning environment they needed.  Please don’t cut the program at Morningside.  It will be devastating to my family to lose this option.  Woodstock is too far away from us to be a viable option.  Please keep the ALC program at Morningside or a more central school like Driggs.

9/17/2025 21:52:41,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Olympus,"The moving of the Morningside ALC is a very hard change. Moving the classes another 11 minutes away adds a heavy burden on parents. 

In conversations I’ve heard it is assumed that bussing the kids makes it all okay. Yes, buses make this idea theoretically possible. But parents have to get their kids to bus stops some distance away - .7 miles for my kid to get to Evergreen. Most of these kids have siblings who aren’t in the program. This means parents will often have to figure out how to be two places at the same time. Also, in elementary school there are lots of mid day activities or programs not to mention the back and forth of sick kids, forgotten assignments, and so on. And, don’t forget that in middle school parents are suddenly burdened with either bringing their kids back to the boundary school or having to trek across town to keep their kid with friends. 

Moving the program so far away makes it so only parents with lots of resources (time, transportation, child care) and parents who have beyond desperate will accept. We already know that many parents find the sacrifices required of the ALC program prohibitive - I can’t remember the rate of people turning it down but it speaks to how the program makes things hard for kids and parents. We talk about the ALC program being something that is needed for kids who can’t get help in regular classes. In other words these are kids with high needs at school, and in the rest of their lives. This move to Woodstock makes me feel like the ALC program is lip service to helping parents out. Maybe split grade classes or picking kids up at their door or some other options should be considered before just throwing the burden back on parents. 

I sometimes wonder if we muddy the waters of our discussions with ALC. It sometimes gets lumps with stem or dual language programs. We talk as if it’s a  perk a specialty program. We reason and make decisions on the assumption that lots of parents drive all over town for their kid to go to the special programs (French? Wasatch?). And, understandably the granite school district encourages this. But the ALC program is a service like speech therapy or special education. Do kids need to start driving thirty minutes multiple times a week to see their speech therapist?? How would this set-up change our speech outcomes?

Students with more resources will be fine with the move from Morningside to Woodstock. It’s a lot less clear how the vulnerable or less rich or families with more kids will fair. If this is how it’s set up in the whole district and children are twenty or thirty minutes away from the ALC schools I think the whole program with its purposes needs to be looked at more closely. "
9/18/2025 13:05:48,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,"Clearly, we as ALC parents are upset you are proposing to close the ALC program that feeds into Olympus and Skyline. With this proposal there will no longer be an ALC program in Millcreek or Holladay, and ALC-eligible kids would have to commute to Murray. Not only is this a burdensome commute, it’s also not great because it disrupts their social networks.

The proposed changes do not any any way help schools that are struggling with low enrollment in Area 5 such as Upland Terrace, Crestview, Cottonwood and even Rosecrest. But keeping an ALC program within Area 5, separate from Woodstock, could be a solution to help one of these schools. 

The ALC program, as currently functioning within this area, IS loved, IS working, IS providing value, thus closing this program, when it doesn’t add any additional costs, conveys that the district does not care about our kids. Our kids are in ALC because their needs are not being met by their local area school. Whatever you want to debate about numbers, the truth is that the current ALC structure is doing exactly what the district intends— helping those kids whose needs are not met by local area schools— which is EVERY child currently at ALC.

Please consider all the comments you have heard and continue to hear, and prove to us that the district actually listens to its constituents and cares about its children. All any of us want for our kids is an exceptional public school education. Please do not knowingly take this away from us. "

Morningside El,Olympus,"I would like to say a huge ""THANK YOU!"" to the Board and PAC for reconsidering the consolidation of the ALC program at this time. My student is an ALC second grader at Morningside Elementary and is growing tremendously in this program, both academically and socially. I believe access to the ALC curriculum is incredibly important for public school students. Our ALC teachers have tremendous expertise in understanding the unique needs of these students (who tend to have a higher proportion of neurodiverse characteristics, per research) and are wonderfully adept at integrating support for all learners into their classroom management. These teachers are an incredible asset to the Granite School District. Thank you again to all Board and PAC members for this decision! "

Eastwood El,Skyline,"My child (I have several more on the way into the school system) tested into the ALC program last year but we decided to stay at Eastwood after we saw and heard that Eastwood's traditional program was likely better than Morningside's ALC program.

My recommendation is that wherever the ALC program goes, it should probably go to a school that ranks higher than its adjacent schools so as to attract more of the top % students into the ALC program. And, it should probably stay in the Skyline network for close to that same reason. And, I think one of the east side programs should discontinue for the reasons mentioned in the Sept. 2nd recommendation and to make the ALC program as effective and attractive as possible.

I would recommend looking into how many students tested into the ALC program but chose not to go, by school. That might rightfully influence the decision of where to put the program."
