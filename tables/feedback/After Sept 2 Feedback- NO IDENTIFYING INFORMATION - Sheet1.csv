There are too many kids to have it be integrated into the same class with Woodstock, there would need to be two classes each grade anyway, so having it be at another school is feasible. "

My daughter currently attends Driggs Elementary and under the new proposal she will be rezoned to Cottonwood (we live on Valley View). Per the meeting the rezoning will affect approximately 100 students, 30 from South of Apple Blossom area and 70 from West of Holladay Blvd. These 100 students are currently attending Driggs and even with the rezoning I am certain that 90% if not all will request special permit to continue attending Driggs. Based on the new projected numbers Driggs wouldn't have a problem accommodating these students because they would still have the capacity, even with the new Morningside students attending. I know the final decision has not been decided yet, but I am curious how the priority of these special permits will look. We only have two years left of elementary after this year, I would hate for my daughter to special permit for 4th grade and then not get in the following year. I also see a problem, with Cottonwood only pulling from Driggs for new students, my feeling is families are very happy at Driggs and would be hesitant to go to Cottonwood when it feels like it is not a thriving school. I appreciate all the effort and consideration that has been made in these recommendations. "

The proposal mentions moving ALC program to Woodstock which feeds into Bonneville Jr High then Cottonwood high. Currently, I do not think Cottonwood high has the ability to do offer IB program which would be disservice to all of these brilliant kids.  Lets assume kids at ALC woodstock decide to move to Churchill/Wasatch Jr which feeds to Skyline High (only high school that offers IB in Granite district on east side) but then they are at risk of loosing their long term social relationships. Due to difference in feeding schools and the effect this would have on future endeavors, I strongly recommend ALC program remains at Morning side just like they are proposing for dual emersion French program.

We live in Emigration Canyon where the commute for some kids is already 30+ minutes. Closing Eastwood is making a further commute for these kids and creating one mega boundary to include Emigration to go to Oakridge. I know myself and a lot of other Eastwood parents are prepared to pull our kids out of the district and into a charter school if this is the decision made. There repeated message of trying to attract students from other schools and districts instead of focusing on the ones that are already in these schools and how they will be affected was absolutely appalling.

Moving the ALC program to Woodstock would significantly increase the time we spend driving every day--this is a big burden and logistical problem for our family. And it would affect other families even more--for example, families in the Eastwood boundaries would spend at least an hour every day driving to and from Woodstock. This is a waste of children's time and parents' resources. If sufficient ALC kids live in Area 5 to fill an ALC program, it seems unduly burdensome to send them all to a different area. So I hope the ALC program will remain within Area 5 boundaries."

We are so thankful for your tireless work in supporting the students of GSD. 

All of our children have participated in the ALC program at Morningside. The three oldest are now in 11th/7th/7th and thriving at Evergreen and Olympus. The academic and social aspects of the ALC program were critical in their development and most importantly, their love for school and learning that they continue to carry with them. Our oldest son would have been lost socially in a traditional classroom, but being other students who love to read, connect cognitively and verbally were life saving for him. Our twins (girls), now in seventh grade were significantly impacted by the depth of instruction and differentiation of education made possible by their ALC teachers and classmates. Their confidence in their academic abilities, especially in math and science are a gift I attribute to their ALC experience

Currently, we have a first grader in the Morningside ALC program where she is thriving and loving her teacher [teacher name removed]. The proposal to move the ALC to Woodstock creates a painful predicament for our family-[student name removed] could potentially have to attend three different schools in three years. As we understand it, she could move to Woodstock next year and then retest for third. It sounds like admittance will drop by around 40% and so if she doesn’t test in we will be stuck looking for another option for her in third grade, and since we are in the WP/spanish DLI boundaries our own neighborhood school isn’t a great option.  

We are sympathetic to all of the conflicting demands at play, but wanted to draw your eye to the particular challenge this proposal brings to the first grade ALC class. As we considered this dilemma, a few ideas came to our minds that would soften the impact.

Our preference as a family would be to keep the ALC program at Morningside and let the current first graders continue through and complete fifth grade there. If that isn’t feasible under the current circumstances, it would ease our minds greatly if [student name removed] (and all first and second graders) could be guaranteed acceptance in the ALC through fifth grade if she moves to Woodstock next year.

Continuity and stability are core values for us, and before deciding on the ALC we had [student name removed] enrolled in private school for first grade as we were nervous about the upcoming changes in the district and we didn’t want to disrupt her academic, social and emotional experience with multiple school moves. Our highest goal is that she loves school and learning and that level of chaos would unquestionably have a negative impact on her.

We truly appreciate you, and acknowledge our general place of privilege to be able to educate our children and have so many capable leaders invested in making our district the best it can be. We would be so grateful if you could consider our suggestions and concerns moving forward and communicate them as you see fit.

Truly,

Morningside El,Olympus,The ALC Program,"The ALP program at Morningside Elementary should absolutely be preserved, even if it is located at another school. For children in the 2nd grade program, suddenly having half the spots available while testing into third grade and facing the breakup of their cohort (which is presented as an important component of the program) will be extremely detrimental to the students academic and social progress. These programs are crucial for students with particular needs and learning goals, and cutting this program seriously challenges the district's stated mission of ""challenging students to achieve their highest potential"".

I am the mom of two students at morningside elementary. One of my kids attend the Alc program. We received a message that our school, along with Eastwood elementary is potentially going to close. I had to write this message because I want to know what this closure study is all about. This doesn’t seem like a sound solution to any of the proclaimed issues with low attendance or old buildings etc. This seems like a political or monetary decision that will take away a public school from the neighborhood. Morningside will become a French dli school and the neighborhood families will be kicked out and have to drive to Woodstock elementary????? The school with almost 100% attendance and a great Alc program will close???? The building will remain??? And the cottonwood elementary with low attendance and same old infrastructure is not even on the list??? I really would like to know what this really is all about. How can you close two schools within a mile of each other. This move will only fix the attendance problem in oakridge elementary. And all other schools with enrollment issues will remain while Morningside will become a low enrollment school and not available to neighborhood families.

I know at least a dozen of other neighborhood families who will have to separate their kids, based on different programs or drive them miles away. This doesn’t seem fair. I hope you will revisit your decision. You made very many families upset and basically got rid of the ALC program because none of the Alc families I know will consider the Woodstock elementary as an option. All these deserving kids will end up at the traditional track unless you keep the school open. 

Thank you for your service,

9/3/2025 13:32:38,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,The ALC Program,"I’m writing to express serious concern about the recommendation to move all Advanced Learning Center (ALC) students from Morningside to Woodstock. While I support the value of public education and want to see Granite School District succeed, this proposal feels like a serious oversight in terms of accessibility and student well-being.

For families in Immigration Canyon, Eastwood, and nearby neighborhoods, this change would mean an hour or more commute each day. That is not a reasonable expectation for elementary-aged children, and it raises questions about how this decision accounts for student health, family logistics, and equity across the district.

Adding to the frustration, Morningside is slated to remain open for the Dual Immersion program. Why is the ALC program not included there as well, particularly given its success and the precedent that other ALC sites are already located within their communities rather than requiring this level of commute?

If families are left with no viable option other than these long daily commutes, many of us will feel forced to leave Granite School District in favor of charter or private schools. That’s a choice I would prefer not to make, as I strongly believe in supporting public education—but this decision, as it stands, undermines that commitment.

I am asking for clarity: what data and reasoning led to this recommendation and how was the burden of hour-long commutes and the decision to exclude ALC from Morningside factored into the analysis? Without a clear, thoughtful answer, this feels like a miscalculation that puts efficiency above the needs of children and families."

Recommending to close it instead destroys all trust in Granite's leadership. Not a mistake we will make twice.

Why would you also recommend moving the Morningside ALC program out to Woodstock? We need these programs in our area too. Why wouldn't you keep it nearer to its current location? Why not keep ALC at Morningside, if it will remain open for DLI anyway? Or move ALC to Eastwood or Oakridge?

If Eastwood is closed and ALC moves so far away, I don't see any way that we would remain with Granite School District."

Driggs El,Olympus,A Boundary Change,"I am one of the ~100 affected people going to Driggs who would be reassigned to Cottonwood elementary. I can assure you that the families in this area are heartbroken and upset that this is a “consideration” (what seems more like a decision) to push us out of our Driggs community after years of being part of it with our own kids. My husband went to Driggs, my sister in law taught there for many years and our entire network and extended families attend Driggs. You have to recognize it’s part of our identity and the reason we purchased our home where we did. For us as families that have been established at Driggs, you need to anticipate and allow us to continue there if we desire. New families over time will adapt and attend their boundary school, but for those of us in the middle of raising elementary-age children, you need to recognize the challenges that come from ripping apart a community and singling out 100 or so people. We want reassurance that we have flexibility to attend Driggs if that meets the needs of our family. In our time at Driggs, it is clear that Driggs has accepted a large amount of families to go to Driggs who live far out of the boundary. I know a number of families who live in Taylorsville, at 7th east, 5th east, etc. and are currently grandfathered into the exception list to attend Driggs. If they are allowed this exception, you need to allow and assure that any of us who are impacted who never needed or wanted an exception are allowed that while we raise our children. Also Crestview and Driggs are both closer to our area and I don’t understand why Cottonwood of all places is where we would be directed. This seems to add skepticism of the validity of these decisions. 

We also live within close vicinity (.5 miles) to Olympus Junior High and therefore expect to attend this school as well as Olympus High. If the rumors are true that in 5-7 years that Oakwood and Cottonwood elementaries will feed into Cottonwood High, you will have more upset families in the future as that decision would make no sense for those affected by this shift to Driggs to Cottonwood. Please make decisions that make sense for the geographical location of families as well as the network that are in currently. 

I am also deeply concerned that decisions regarding our schools are being made for selfish reasons. I was informed that Julie Jackson attended Cottonwood elementary as a child and is hyper focused on “saving” Cottonwood elementary because she went there. If this is motivating the decisions, this type of behavior from our government is corrupt and self interested, an extreme conflict of interest, and families who are being forced to go to Cottonwood against their will are extremely upset with her personally, and are and will continue to speak about this loudly to the community.

Rosecrest El",Olympus,"The ALC Program, Morningside Closure","Closing Eastwood makes sense, and that conclusion kind of jumps off the page. Closing Morningside, and the associated boundary changes, also makes sense given its proximity to other schools and its isolated boundary near Rosecrest. Two things that don’t seem to make as much sense:
1. “Closing” morningside but keeping it open with even fewer students. Isn’t one of the primary purposes to save money by gaining efficiencies?  This seems to do the opposite of that. Fewer students, but they still need an office staff, principal, library, janitorial, lunch, arts, building maintenance, etc.  
2. Consolidating the ALC program to Woodstock.  That isn’t even in the area where any of the affected families live.  Consolidating it at a more central location would make more sense for all of the families… otherwise are we just shifting any savings to the cost to bussing and/or adding an extra 40 min of commute time each day?  Are we just going to push more families to consider private options or to abandon the program (I hope not)?  And if morningside isn’t closing, why make that change at all?  What is gained by this consolidation?  Why not keep the ALC program at Morningside (if it’s going to be kept open anyway) or move French to Woodstock, where a more central location would be a benefit for attracting more students from across the valley?  Or, close Morningside completely and adjust the boundaries of the area schools to create space for the two programs at separate schools but within the area?  This latter suggested change should free up significant annual resources ($2M?) to invest in the students across the area (dance, music, art, technology, more full time K, etc). "
9/8/2025 10:49:18,C) I am an employee of Granite School District,5. Morningside El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, The DLI Program, Other","Thank you for taking the time to read and consider the feedback regarding the recent announcement of the PAC's recommendation to the board.
Of course I have personal feelings regarding the recommended school closures because I am employed at one of those schools.  But I recognize that there is often a need for change, and that change is inevitably a tricky thing to navigate.    
What I feel most confused by is the seeming disparity between what was presented at the public meetings as the main problem and reason for school closures and the proposed outcome of the closures.  Every reason that was touted--changing demographics, need for increased enrollment for robust schools and programs, and safe travel routes--seems to have been set aside to instead promote a singular area of focus for each school. 
If having a specific focus for each school is the actual aim, that should be made clear as the district's goal.  Perhaps that is something that can be clarified in coming discussions and meetings.
Additionally, if Morningside unique program is recommended as a DLI school, perhaps another DLI program could be added so that there will be a four class model from the get go.  For example, move the Chinese DLI from Oakwood to share the school with the French DLI at Morningside.  Similarly, if the district has desires to continue to serve their gifted learner population, the board might consider moving the ALC program to a more central location in the district so that more students from the west side could attend, or to create a strictly ALC program school.  That way there won't be the discrepancy between two or more programs, creating the them vs. us mentality that the district stated it wanted to avoid."

For elementary school she attended the Morningside ALC Program. While the closure of Eastwood does not affect my daughter's education, it does have a direct impact on my family and those around us. We (and many other neighbors) use the open space at Eastwood. It provides a safe space for us and our kids to play at without having to cross major roads and intersections. Furthermore, I would like to point out that there are many other user groups that may not be aware of the closure, including groups that use the open space for youth soccer, softball, baseball, and other such users like paragliders who use it as a landing space. 

Many of our open spaces in urban are under threat of development. While I'm not here to comment on whether or not this is justified or if there is a conflict of interest, I do want to make it clear that the current green/open space at Eastwood should remain green/open space. We do not want housing or commercial development to take over this space. There is a rumor that the school will be used for a fire department. Most of my neighbors agree that this would be a good use of the property so long as the green/open space is not developed and remains accessible to all user groups.

The ALC was a big draw for us for the region and to attend Morningside Elementary.  We attended the ALC meeting at Morningside on 9/11.

We walked into the meeting with an completely open mind about attending Woodstock for ALC with the closure of Morningside.  

However, it was very disappointing to see that the data provided was incomplete.  When questions arose about the districts data for this region as well other regions withing Granite there was no appropriate answer.  No specific were provided except for the information in the 11 slides that were presented.   None of the questions were answered appropriately, and there was no attempt to convince any of the parents that this was the correct decision based on the data presented and ability to answer the questions.  My overall take was the district is doing a disservice to the area 5 population and specifically the ALC program.  The decision seems premature.  In fact It is to the point that I cannot in good faith plan to send my child to a non-skyline network school if the district is treating the ALC children this way.  I have lots my faith in the ability for Granite School District to teach the Gifted and Talented children appropriately.  I feel as if it is better to stay within Granite but in the Skyline network based on the long standing reputation of high academic excellence in this network.    

In my mind the simplest answer is to keep the ALC program at Morningside along with the French DLI program.  It seems like there is no way for the French program to be full in the next 1-2 years.  The District should treat Morningside as a DLI and ALC magnet similar to the ALC and Spanish DLI school on the west side.  This would make a comparable school on the opposite side of the Valley with an ALC option within the Skyline network.   I would also ask for the board to commission an analysis on the entire ALC program (not only at Morningside but the rather the entire district) in order to make a unified and better decision in the next 2-3 years.

Morningside El,Skyline,Morningside Closure," I urge you to consider the educational needs of Morningside Traditional Learners.  The Morningside parent and teacher representatives on the PAC study subcommittee were all DLI and Accelerated Learning. The subcommittee failed to represent Traditional Track Morningside families in any way. The PAC has crafted solutions that beautifully meet the needs of DLI and Accelerated Learning families. The solutions do not address any concerns brought up through public comment by Traditional Track Morningside families. Due to our lack of representation on the subcommittee, please consider the following modification to PAC's recommendation: 

Proceed with PAC recommendations with the following single modification:
 
Keep Morningside open as a French DLI AND Traditional Track School. Follow a congruent model to William Penn and other immersion schools in Granite School District.
Justification & Benefits to Granite School District and Students:
·       Increased retention of students in Granite School District. Students often fluctuate in and out of immersion programs. If a student decides that French DLI is not a good fit, they can simply switch to the Traditional Track within the same school. This will increase the likelihood of out-of-district students that were attracted to the DLI school to remain within Granite School District if they decide to leave DLI. 
·       Prevent overcrowding and exceptionally large class sizes at Oakridge. Eastwood boundary students can be split between Morningside and Oakridge to create more balanced schools.
o   A projected new enrollment of 520 at Oakridge with a max building capacity of 550 is very risky to future enrollment needs.
·       Increased student safety. Morningside boundary students have a much safer walk to Morningside compared to walking to Driggs. As a parent, the thought of 100+ Morningside boundary students walking along 4500 S to Driggs is terrifying. If families choose to drive, the drop off/pick up zone will be extremely congested, creating hazards to students and staff on campus.
·       Allow special education students to continue to thrive. Morningside Elementary has one of the strongest special education teams in the district. Dismantling this skilled team will result in harmful implications to some of our district’s most vulnerable learners.

Morningside has a reputation of being a good school. Because French is a less popular language than Spanish, it will be more difficult to grow. I think possible with some work, but I think you will need to rely on Morningside’s name for recognition and reputation.

Instead, you stayed focused on the data, the needs of the district, and the importance of building a stronger, more sustainable future. That takes leadership.

The recommendations reflect what I hoped to see: careful analysis, community input, and a clear commitment to what’s best for kids — not just what’s easiest politically. Please know that many of us in the community see and appreciate the integrity and responsibility with which this process has been carried out."

Like many others in the ALC program, our child is both exceptionally academically gifted (she has standardized IQ scores in the 99 to 99.9% nationally) and also has special needs [identyfing information removed]. She tried a private school for kindergarten and the gifted cluster at Crestview for first grade and neither of them provided the combination of educational rigor and behavioral support she needs. Finally, in second grade, we have found what she needs at Morningside. The program is extremely successful and experienced at helping these very capable but challenging kids thrive, largely because of the integration/coordination among extremely experienced classroom teachers and the social worker [teacher name removed]. She even offers something our child’s psychologist recommended that we can’t find anywhere else even in private settings: a social skills group for gifted kids. Simply opening ALC classes at another school rather than moving the entire program as a whole would not be nearly adequate to meet our daughter’s needs. I hope the board will seriously consider keeping the entire program intact wherever it goes. 

I’d also like to mention that the gifted clusters in local classrooms, while a good idea and despite wonderful teachers, are seriously inadequate for academically gifted kids. We’ve had two children in them and they learned almost nothing all year because they started years ahead of grade level. They have stayed with same-age neighborhood peers for social-emotional reasons, but the district really shouldn’t let academic talent like that be so wasted when leveled learning isn’t that hard to implement."

Thank you for the thoughtful work you are doing on the boundary and program study. I know these decisions are difficult and will have lasting impacts on schools and families across our district.

While the ALC program at Morningside may not be especially large in terms of enrollment, the cultural impact of hosting a specialty program within a small neighborhood school can be significant. When only part of a school participates in a program, it can create a divide between students who are in it and those who are not. This impacts school culture and community relationships in ways that numbers and data do not always show.

As a Rosecrest parent, I want to be clear that I do not want the ALC program placed at Rosecrest. Our school is already small, and I believe introducing a separate program would create unnecessary division instead of strengthening our community.

I believe each school should have one clear identity. If a school has a specialty program, that program should involve the entire school community rather than dividing it between multiple tracks. For this reason, I thought the idea of combining the ALC program at Woodstock made sense. Centralizing the program is more sustainable, and if families truly value ALC, they will be willing to travel to access it.

Thank you for considering this perspective as you move forward in your decision-making process.

Sincerely,

I'm [name removed] a Utah paraglider pilot who recently heard of the changes happening within the GSD, particularly the closure of Eastwood Elementary. I imagine closing a school is no easy decision or feat. So I'm simply writing to express my love for the school as a legacy paragliding landing zone. 

My first mountain flight in the Wasatch was from Grandeur, and I remember feeling grateful for the green school yard as I soared thousands of feet over the city. The landing was safe and uneventful, like most landings within our community. 

No matter what decisions are made about Eastwood Elementary, I hope the grounds remain an open green rec space for everyone in the community to enjoy. Please know you have the support of Utah Hang gliding and Paragliding pilots.

Best wishes for the students, teachers, parents, and school board involved.

9/23/2025 11:53:03,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,4. Eastwood El,Olympus,Eastwood Closure,"I wanted to share my support of the closure of Eastwood.  Overall we enjoy the school but have seen the negative impact of having a small school population.  

I would like to see more information about how student and teacher support will increase with the combination of Eastwood and Oakridge.  What additional programs, support, etc can be added with a larger school population?

- Split classes are difficult for both students and teachers
- We left a private school with only one class per grade to come to Eastwood hoping for more than one class per grade.  Having the ability to break up/separate some kids for a year can be really helpful, but with only one class this isn't an option. It also gives an opportunity for best fit of teacher to student.  
- Reduced student support has been seen with the smaller school population.  There is more reliance on parent support in the classroom, some of the other STEM, Art, and special education programs cannot be fully staffed with the lower school population. 
- More teacher pressure- with fewer staff the main teacher gets much less planning time.  

Notes:
Eastwood is not our home school.  We should be at William Penn.  
The support for not closing eastwood seems to be coming primarily from ""eastwood is my home school"" families.  We have no connection to Eastwood other than some other friends who happen to be there, ie have have ""no skin in the game"", we will be driving to any school we go to.  This support doesn't seem to have anything to do with child outcomes but a ""not in my backyard"".  
I would much rather have my kids be at a larger school with more teacher and student support, more opportunities for friends.  This is what I feel will happen with the combo of eastwood and oakridge.
At this point we will most likely not stay at eastwood going forward, it feels like it will only get smaller as many people are discussing their options.

Eastwood El,Olympus,Eastwood Closure,"I strongly oppose the proposed closure of Eastwood Elementary. One of the main reasons I purchased my home in this neighborhood was its proximity to quality schools. If Eastwood closes, Oakridge will be pushed to max capacity, effectively doubling class sizes and diminishing the quality of education. Our property taxes continue to rise, with nearly a third going to schools, so it is unacceptable to claim Eastwood is suddenly unsustainable after serving our community for over 50 years. Any funds collected locally should be fully reallocated to support Oakridge—not redistributed to other towns.

I am also very concerned about what happens to the Eastwood property. Selling to the highest bidder would almost certainly bring a shopping plaza or high-density housing, both of which would increase traffic and negatively impact property values. The town must commit to protecting our neighborhood schools, ensuring tax dollars benefit our children directly, and guaranteeing that any repurposing of Eastwood serves the community—not outside developers."

We chose to buy our home here because of the schools, and removing Eastwood will force all those students into Oakridge, creating overcrowded classrooms and reducing the quality of education. It makes no sense that after more than 50 years of serving the community, Eastwood is suddenly on the chopping block—especially when school taxes continue to climb and make up a large share of our property bills. Those dollars should stay in our neighborhood to directly support Oakridge, not get spread to other districts.

I am equally worried about the fate of the Eastwood property. If the land is sold off to a developer, we will likely end up with high-density housing or commercial use that increases traffic and hurts property values. Our town should prioritize keeping neighborhood schools open, ensuring our tax dollars support our children, and guaranteeing that any future use of Eastwood benefits the community instead of outside developers."

Churchill Jr",Skyline,"The DLI Program, Eastwood Closure, Other","First, I am worried that the changes with Eastwood, Oakridge, Morningside, and Driggs will lead to Churchill having lower enrollment over the next few years. In turn, Churchill will need to close. I don't want a cohort of students facing two school closures and the associated disruptions. Next, students who walk to Oakridge don't have a reasonably safe path to get there. If this plan goes through, you will be significantly increasing the number of children who walk on unsafe walkways each morning. I know the that the School Board doesn't have control over sidewalks, but it does have control over why it does and doesn't recommend a school. I hope it recommends against the merger of Eastwood and Oakridge due to the lack of safe walking paths for our children. It has been mentioned that there will be a marketing campaign for Morningside. I wish you'd do this for Eastwood-the only Gold Star STEAM program in Granite. We could boost enrollment to have a sustainable student body that justifies Eastwood's existence. Last, I don't think that the DLI program at Morningside makes any sense. I realize you have data that suggests that there could be demand, especially if you have teachers who are from French-speaking countries who speak French as their native tongue. Without seeing the data, it's hard to believe that, over the next few years, 500 students will want to learn French enough to come to Morningside. Given recent federal level changes, it's hard to imagine that you will be able to recruit foreign teachers. I fear this plan will lead to the closer of Morningside. The closing of Morningside would render one of the closing of Morningside's other programs and/or the closure of Eastwood unnecessary. "

Eastwood El,Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"This point isn’t about Eastwood versus Oakridge. It’s about whether we’ve performed adequate due diligence before making a final decision on December 2nd. Here’s the core question: If the district’s implied goal has been to fight a long-term average annual enrollment decline of 2%, why would we recommend closing Eastwood—a stable school with less than 1% annual attrition—and send those students to Oakridge, a great school but one that has 6% annual attrition, which is more than double the district average? The latest mobility data as of February of this year, shows: Eastwood has lost just 7 students total over 6 years, whereas Oakridge has steadily lost 161 students over the same period. Stated in another way, Oakridge lost 37% of its students in these 6 years whereas Eastwood lost only 2%. Note, this attrition isn’t directly pandemic related as, in the last year, Oakridge lost 7% of enrollment or 22 students. As an Eastwood parent, my questions is – why does Oakridge have such stubborn and aggressive attrition and how will that affect my four children who might go there? Again, this point is not about pitting one school against the other—it’s about whether we are making decisions with complete information. My concern: The September 2nd recommendation didn’t include any note on attrition, nor a head-to-head comparative analysis between Eastwood and Oakridge—or other key metrics that should inform such a consequential decision such as out-of-district student pull, etc. Before moving forward, we must ask: 1) Do we have sufficient data to evaluate the full costs and risks of this closure by December 2nd? 2) Have we explored and attempted to mitigate those specific risks, especially around enrollment decline? For the sake of our students, families, and community, these are questions that deserve thorough answers before a final decision is made."

Olympus High",Olympus,Other,"I am concerned about the potential low enrollment at cotton wood next year because many rezoned driggs students will opt to stay at Driggs.  Two possible actions to improve future enrollment:

1. The PAC’s current plan splits the population in this area among three different schools, giving Driggs enough students for approximately 3.5 classes per grade, Oakwood 3.5 classes/grade, and Cottonwood 2.5 classes/grade. We need a more equitable split. Rezoning all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive would potentially yield us (Cottonwood) 220 new students, giving each school approximately 3 classes/grade. Per state law, re-zoned students have the opportunity to special permit back into their previous school, so we will likely only get a fraction of the 100 students the PAC is currently re-zoning to us. 

2. Send Morningside’s ALC (gifted) program to Cottonwood: The PAC is currently looking for a new home for Morningside’s ALC program. As the top-scoring elementary school in our district, the ALC is a good culture fit at our Cottonwood and would be attractive to high-performing families. Having the gifted program would benefit our school by attracting siblings of ALC students and waitlisted ALC students, retaining zoned students who leave for the ALC program, and by having more teachers in the building to share the workload.

9/23/2025 18:17:07,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,1. Cottonwood El,Olympus,A Boundary Change,"Hello, my name is [name removed] and I am in support of revising the Area 5 boundary proposal to add more students to Cottonwood Elementary so the school consistently reaches at least three classes per grade.

By the District’s own standard, any school averaging fewer than three teachers per grade is considered “small,” which brings very predictable problems: split grade classrooms, weaker teacher collaboration, reduced program supports, and pressure on class sizes.  

Cottonwood is currently staffed for two classes per grade, and the draft would only move us to about 2.5 classes per grade on average, still below the District’s threshold and exactly the zone where split classes and oversized sections recur. That outcome doesn’t meet the stated planning goal for right-sizing schools and will perpetuate the very “small school concerns” the PAC process is meant to solve.  

There’s a straightforward fix the community supports, zone all students below 4500 South and east of Highland Drive to Cottonwood Elementary. The current plan divides that same pocket among three schools, over-enrolling Driggs and Oakwood near 3.5 classes per grade while leaving Cottonwood below 3. A more equitable split would bring each school closer to the three per grade target, reducing splits and stabilizing class sizes.  

The proposal to close Eastwood and convert Morningside into a DLI only campus changes where general education enrollment can go. Keeping Cottonwood under the three per grade mark while reassigning neighborhood students elsewhere undermines program sustainability at Cottonwood and fragments communities. 

Special-permit rules mean not every rezoned student will actually move; many can apply to stay at their current school. If Cottonwood is projected at ~2.5 teachers per grade on paper, the real number could dip even lower after permits—another reason to zone a larger area to Cottonwood now to reliably meet the three-per-grade standard.  

I’m asking the PAC to revise boundaries so Cottonwood reaches a stable three classes per grade, aligning with District criteria, improving teacher collaboration, avoiding split grades, and ensuring equitable class sizes across Area 5. Thank you.

Thank you to the administration, the board, and the rest of the community members here for your interest, time, and effort in behalf of our community. I just have a comment. This comment isn’t about Eastwood versus Oakridge. It’s about whether we’ve done sufficient due diligence before making a final decision on December 2. Here’s the core question: if the district’s goal is to counter a long-term 2% average annual enrollment decline, why would we recommend closing Eastwood, a stable school with <2% annual enrollment decline, and send those students to Oakridge, a great school—but one with ~6% annual enrollment decline, more than double the district average? Per the new data provided at the Olympus high meeting last night: Eastwood has lost only 34 students total over the last seven years or AFTER the 6th grade change impact — averaging less than 2% enrollment decline per year. Oakridge, on the other hand, lost the same number of students — 34 — in just the last year alone. Over the same seven-year period, Oakridge’s total decline was 195 students, which represents a 37% enrollment drop. This shows a clear pattern: Eastwood has been remarkably stable, while Oakridge has faced persistent, high attrition year after year. This isn’t to criticize Oakridge; it is to highlight a risk. If we move students from a low-attrition environment into a higher-attrition one without a clear plan, we may unintentionally accelerate the very decline we’re trying to solve—and push more families to charters or out of the district entirely. My concern: the September 2 recommendation did not include an attrition analysis, a head-to-head comparison between Eastwood and Oakridge, or related metrics like out-of-district pull. Before moving forward, we should be able to answer these two questions: 1) do we have sufficient data to evaluate the full costs and risks of this closure by December 2? And, 2) have we explored and mitigated the specific risks—especially around enrollment decline? And, I have two additional requests before any final vote: 1) an objective comparative analysis between Eastwood and Oakridge - side by side. And, more importantly, 2) an Oakridge stabilization plan that identifies root causes of enrollment decline and sets time-bound targets (e.g., retention, net mobility), with actions and accountability. If that level of analysis can’t be completed credibly by December 2, then delay or make the decision conditional on meeting these due-diligence items. For the sake of our students, families, and the district’s long-term health, these questions deserve thorough answers before a final decision is made. Thank you.

Eastwood El,Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"Hello, my name is [name removed], I am an Eastwood parent. I am making a comment. Members of the Eastwood community has done some research with 1) the community and 2) canyon rim academy that we feel is important for the district to consider now in preparing the next recommendation. Canyon Rim Academy — a top-performing charter school and one of the district’s biggest competitors — is completing a brand-new, earthquake-resistant campus set to open next school year. Eastwood is not only closer to Canyon Rim than Oakridge, but up to 14% of Eastwood’s current students live within just a half-mile of Canyon Rim Academy. For the first time, Canyon Rim is beginning to pull significantly from its two-mile enrollment tier — which completely overlaps with Eastwood’s boundary. This means that any students displaced by an Eastwood closure are very likely to enroll there. Based on our projections, this could double annual enrollment decline at each of the adjacent schools within the second tier, i.e. Rosecrest, Upland terrace, and Eastwood, and half of Penn, over the next few years. This raises two critical questions: Why this year? Why close Eastwood in the exact year Canyon Rim opens a brand-new facility? How many of Canyon Rim’s new students will come directly from Eastwood families? To understand our community’s perspective, we surveyed 45% of Eastwood families — nearly all in-boundary families — despite not being able to use school property or official channels. The results were clear: When asked about transferring to Oakridge, the response was split and leaning negative. When asked about attending a charter school, the response was strongly supportive, with most families favoring that option. In other words, if Eastwood closes now, many families will leave the district altogether. Three takeaways: Closing a school within Canyon Rim’s two-mile zone without addressing competition will accelerate district enrollment loss. Closing an older school the same year a competitor opens a modern facility is high-risk. Please perform this level of due diligence by December 2nd or take one more year to fully analyze these dynamics before finalizing this decision — the timing matters, and so do the voices of Eastwood families.

We recognize that change is hard, and always brings some challenges, but we are very much looking forward to the proposed changes, specifically those affecting our 3rd grader in DLI. With our past experiences at Morningside we recognize that having the school fully devoted to a DLI program would be such a blessing to those students in many ways by being immersed in a full DLI school culture. They will be able to be proud of that opportunity and accomplishment and not have to be so sensitive to not hurt feelings or step on toes of others not in the program. We are also excited about the tremendous benefits to learning that will come with a full school devoted to DLI. We are happy to specifically list more of the benefits we foresee if this information is helpful in making the final decision. (Please let me know if further information would be helpful.)

Please pause the closure of Morningside until that study is performed. The rationale for initially targeting Morningside was said to be low in-boundary utilization.  However, with a commitment to keep the longstanding ALC and French programs, Steve Hogan acknowledged that total utilization would be more relevant.  I know PAC will not want to recreate the wheel, but given the change in the ALC program recommendations, closing Morningside no longer makes sense.  You are picking a high utilization school with happy, effective programs and are choosing to close it to fill up schools that have lower utilization and numbers.  That is unfair to the Morningside community and creates distrust.  We do not need 3 traditional classrooms to provide options.  We are fine with our model, even if we have to have a split classroom.  We would prefer our imperfect system to the newer, more imperfect system proposed by the PAC.    There is clearly something else going on behind the scenes when you pick a school with happy teachers, kids and parents and decide to split it up to send kids to lower performing and lower utilized schools.  Please PAUSE the closure of Morningside until more analysis can be done.  At the very least, please do not move the ALC program until sufficient French demand has been shown. I do not think that demand will materialize and I am not in favor of my tax moneys being spent to finance a French only school.  Please do not move forward with this plan.  "

The district wanting there to be 3 traditional classrooms per grade isn't sufficient. This is a unique school, I have yet to hear a traditional parent saying that they aren't happy. Families like the options of three tracks, many utilize 2 within their family. It's a way to keep kids together. This is our neighborhood school and the low utilization that is pointed to is in part to the goofy boundary that morningside has that jumps up to the Canyon Rim neighborhood. This is a functioning school right now and to separate this school is irresponsible. To look at two classrooms that are low and say that's proof is cherry picking data to support your goal. Opening a fully French DLI has not been discussed enough in real details. No one has shared ANY data that there is desire from enough families to go from roughly 250 DLI kids to 500. I'm extremely worried that next year and the year after that there won't be enough for four classrooms per grade and we'll end up with split classrooms or overloaded classrooms in an already challenging environment. When that happens are you prepared to give extra support or are you going to just close the French DLI school at that point? This is not just a commuter school, this is in the center of a neighborhood that loves this school. The board members and the superintendent are not answering questions about this. Why do we not hear why Cottonwood shouldn't close? Where are all the options laid out? It's clear these plans aren't considered, you're going to lose far more families with the Eastwood closure than you will gain in this French program you think is going to add to this area. "

 Why did you exclude Emigration Canyon students in the dot map. Did excluding it allow you to claim Oakridge as the central location?   It appears that the majority of students on the dot map  attending from below Wasatch Blvd are closer to Eastwood. 

Eastwood successfully handled student traffic for enrollment  for the last 20 years.  It has drop offs to the parking lot and to the path off Eastwood drive.  

Since both Eastwood and Oakridge have a similar FCI it makes sense that one of the schools will close and the other one will be rebuilt.   So student capacity and drop off issues don’t really apply.  The Olympus cove also has fewer affordable homes for families bringing future students to our area.

Morningside El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, Morningside Closure","Closing Morningside does not achieve the stated goals of the PAC. It would leave the school severely underutilized, create a domino effect on Driggs’ boundaries, and result in split feeders. The counterargument—that Morningside only has one traditional class per grade—seems inconsistent, as other schools in Area 5 would still face that same challenge anyway.

From what I understand, it is difficult to integrate special programs into a school community, yet Morningside has already done that important work. My children play with peers across all tracks, and the school has been intentional in fostering connections beyond individual classes. And many families have kids in multiple tracks. And, at a time when many are turning to attack one another to save their own interests, I have seen families from Morningside come together to support one another and save the school as a whole and not just their individual tracks. Why dismantle a thriving, integrated community only to recreate the same “small school” issue somewhere else?

Additionally, there does not appear to be sufficient data to ensure the long-term success of a stand-alone French DLI school. Dos Mundos is too new to serve as a reliable comparison, particularly given that French and Spanish programs operate in different contexts. Spanish, as a more widely spoken language in our community and state, has a larger base of potential students and resources, while French programs naturally face different participation and sustainability challenges. And where can a student go if they decide French is not for them? Aren’t you just creating a small “French” school problem with less parents to serve on PTA and less teachers to chair committees? Aren’t we increasing overhead costs by running a school at such low capacity? If this experiment fails, what will happen to the French DLI? It seems too big to absorb into any other existing school in area 5.

Morningside closure does not make sense. Please think carefully before disrupting our community.

Thank you."
9/24/2025 22:49:48,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,"10. Upland Terrace El, 14. Wasatch Jr, 17. Skyline High",Skyline,"The ALC Program, A Boundary Change","I was surprised to hear that the PAC Committee has already changed its stance on the ALC program enough so that it already had a new slide in the presentation at Skyline this week. I am very concerned about the possibility of the ALC program coming to our elementary school Upland Terrace. Or any school for that matter. But especially concerned about it coming to Upland.
We love and appreciate the inclusive environment that we currently have at Upland. I also love the integration we are doing with our special education students. At Upland we want programs or activities that benefit the entire student body, not just a small group of students. 
I worry that having a separate program that only a small number of students participate in will bring more exclusion and division. The ALC program by nature divides and separates. There is no way around that. I strongly believe that dividing children based on academic achievement is not necessary in elementary school! There is plenty of time for that in secondary education. And I have heard again and again from teachers saying in their 20 or 30 year career they only ever have taught one or two students that were truly ""gifted"" that they could not  adequately provide for in their general classroom. We have amazing teachers!  We know and love many of the kids currently in the ALC program at Morningside and wish they would come to Upland and be with us. I wish these students would come back to their neighborhood schools and learn, play and grow together! Together instead of apart! 
Now I assume you are not interested in getting rid of the ALC program. I wish you would. You say parents demand it. But I think that is unfortunate. I truly think it would benefit every school in this study to close the ALC program. We have amazing teachers that are qualified and so able to teach these ALC students. That said, since I know you won't get rid of the program please consider moving the ALC program to some place that wants it or can greatly benefit by having it come to their school. We do not want it at Upland Terrace! 
I would suggest you strongly consider moving the ALC program to Cottonwood for several reasons:
1. [name removed] at Cottonwood sent an email out to Cottonwood parents encouraging their parents to advocate and ask for the ALC program to come to Cottonwood. They say teachers want it, that it is a good fit. I realize it is not centrally located and is closer to Woodstock already but if a school wants it, has space for it and NEEDS more students it seems like a great fit. 
2.By putting the ALC program at Cottonwood we could give the boundary that was taken from Driggs back and offset the population. I know the that area of Driggs that has been proposed to now go to Cottonwood are upset and say they will still special permit back to Driggs. They want to go to school where their kids have always gone. Giving the ALC program to Cottonwood helps Driggs keep their community and helps increase student body at Cottonwood which they desperately need. Win-win.
3. Also, I do not believe we need two honors programs to feed into Skyline. Churchhill's pre-IB program will already feed into Skyline. By putting the ALC at Cottonwood you could spread the honors progams to another network. ALC at Cottonwood would strengthen the Olympus Network. I know the ALC parents say they want the program to feed into Skyline but that doesn't have to be the case. If they truly want to come to Skyline they will come. Just as I feel if you truly believe your student needs to be in the ALC program they should be willing to drive as far as Granite tells them to. The ALC does not need to be centrally located. You opt in and should be willing to drive.
We need to do what is best for the largest number of students possible, strengthening as many schools as possible. 
I appreciate you taking the time to read this.

9/25/2025 17:19:49,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,"10. Upland Terrace El, 14. Wasatch Jr",Skyline,The ALC Program,"[Identifying info removed] I’m reaching out to express concerns I’ve heard regarding the possibility of moving the ALC program to Upland.
At the beginning of the PAC study process, the district emphasized its goal to create a complete program for each school. That has not yet been achieved at Upland, and moving the ALC program here would only make it more difficult. We continue to face the challenge of not having three teachers per grade, which our students both need and deserve. Adding five ALC classes would take away the opportunity to grow toward that goal.
Currently, Upland has two strong, inclusive programs—our traditional program and our outstanding Special Education program. These programs work hand in hand, supporting one another in a way that strengthens our whole school community. Adding a third program would stretch resources too thin and undermine the integrity of the programs already thriving here. It risks creating divides rather than fostering the unity Upland has worked so hard to build. Our students—especially our SpEd students—deserve to see their programs supported and protected.
We understand that some ALC parents have expressed concerns about program placement. However, the district’s plan already ensures that ALC students have a program available to them. We ask that equal consideration be given to the many more students who benefit daily from Upland’s traditional and SpEd programs, not just the small percentage served by ALC. Please don’t overlook the majority of children who thrive in our inclusive, healthy, traditional program.
If the district chooses not to keep ALC at Morningside, we urge you to consider moving it to Cottonwood, where we understand both parents and teachers have expressed interest. The concern about proximity to Woodstock does not seem like a strong enough reason to disrupt Upland’s existing programs and stability.
As parents, we are deeply worried that the voices of a small but loud group may be overshadowing the broader needs of many families. Have Upland teachers been consulted about this? From the conversations I’ve had, our teachers are not worried about supporting advanced learners in their traditional classrooms. Their focus is on maintaining the inclusive, supportive environment that Upland is known for.
Please let us know what we, as parents, can do to protect and strengthen our programs. We want to ensure Upland continues moving toward the district’s vision of a complete program, while also finding a fair solution for both ALC families and Upland families.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

9/25/2025 18:09:50,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,Morningside Closure,"It seems like a really rushed decision not based off of facts/data. I don't feel like a lot of the consequences have been thought through thoroughly or researched. We have repeatedly asked for facts and data and have not received what we've asked for. It seems as though there are ulterior motives behind this closure that are not being presented truthfully to the public. I have two kids at Morningside, one in traditional and one in ALC that are both going to be moved to two separate schools. I will have another child entering kindergarten in 2 years, that is 3 children in elementary with the potential of being in 3 separate schools because our neighborhood school is being recommended to close. Changing Morningside to DLI French only, seems like just a step to closing the school fully. There is no data or plans for this plan to succeed and parents' don't want their kids left in a dying school. Many will choose not to go to Morningside because they don't want their kids to be in a ghost town school that will probably shut down soon. I urge the board to vote against the closure of Morningside. I am glad that the decision was made to not reduce the ALC anymore. I hope that the Board will recognize that there needs to be more time and careful planning when considering shutting down a school with 3 distinct tracks. Our students deserve thoughtful planning, this affects their everyday lives, this should not be a rushed decision. "
9/25/2025 22:19:22,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,Morningside Closure,"As a parent of a Traditional Track student at Morningside Elementary, I’m writing to respectfully urge the PAC to reconsider the recommendation to close our school. While I understand the challenges posed by low enrollment in 1st and 2nd grades in the traditional track only, I believe this proposal overlooks the broader strengths of Morningside and the opportunity to build on what’s already working.
Many families have children enrolled across Morningside’s multiple tracks. The ability to remain together in one building is not only logistically important, it’s emotionally grounding. Traditional upper grades are thriving, often with waitlists due to high demand. To dismantle an entire school based on enrollment in just two grade levels feels disproportionate, especially when the broader picture reflects strong, sustained interest across all programs.
On September 18th, over 150 Morningside families formally expressed their desire to remain united. That level of engagement speaks to the deep commitment and cohesion within our community. We are asking for thoughtful investment in a school that is already demonstrating success.
Specifically, I urge the PAC to consider enhancing the Traditional program with a specialized STEM track, similar to the enrichment model being offered at Rosecrest Elementary. Morningside has already secured a CS4All grant for this school year, and students are beginning to benefit from hands-on coding, robotics, and digital literacy experiences. This grant is directly tied to HB 227, the Utah Computer Science Grant Act, which prioritizes equity, inclusion, and innovation. Morningside’s multi-track model makes it an ideal candidate for continued investment under this legislation.
Expanding STEM at Morningside could attract new families, boost early grade enrollment, and deepen learning for current students. While I hope the district’s priority remains serving students within Granite School District, a strengthened STEM program could also draw interest from out-of-district families, bringing in new energy and resources without compromising Granite’s core mission.
With robust Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions, exceptional special education support, and a well-established culture of collaboration, Morningside is uniquely equipped to lead a STEM initiative. Closing the school would fracture a rare and effective ecosystem and disrupt the academic and emotional stability of many children who have found success within it.
I also want to acknowledge the concern around split or combined classrooms. Like many parents and teachers, I agree they should be avoided. However, Ms. Jackson has confirmed publicly that split classrooms will likely still be necessary in other school including Upland Terrace, Crestview, and possibly Rosecrest if the current recommendation is implemented. This raises a critical question: if split classrooms remain part of the district’s future, why target Morningside, a school with a proven STEM mission and strong foundation for closure? Eliminating Morningside doesn’t solve the problem. If Morningside’s STEM program is supported and thoughtfully fostered with HB 227 in mind, split and combined classrooms will likely not be needed in the future at our school. We owe it to all children and families in Area 5 to go back to the drawing board and find a solution that solves the stated mission of the study.
Let’s prioritize the needs of students already within Granite School District. Please reconsider the closure proposal and explore alternative solutions that preserve and strengthen Morningside Elementary. I ask that you extend that same thoughtful lens to Morningside that you are providing to Rosecrest. This is not a failing school. It’s a thriving, collaborative community with strong programs and deep family commitment. I’m asking for support to grow—not a decision to close.
 Let’s build on what’s working, invest in what’s possible, and continue to support all students with thoughtful, inclusive planning.

From attending in-person and viewing the board meetings online, it appears to me that there are really no real answers or guarantees. This is very disconcerting.

We’ve had three children go through the program thus far who have had wonderful experiences, and we believe there is great value in what it provides. That said, as you are planning to study it in greater depth over the next year or two, we implore you to maintain the ALC program at that site while conducting your research.

Not only has the Morningside community benefited enormously from the interactions between varying-track students and their mutual influence and friendships, but we, like many Morningside families, have children in multiple programs, and it would create a significant hardship for us to manage our elementary students at multiple school sites. If ALC is moved to another location, we would potentially be driving our children to four different schools for years to come (we will have a middle-schooler and a high-schooler to transport as well).

Aside from the increased time and logistical challenges, our children who would be at Morningside together are great friends and would really struggle to be split up for years of what would otherwise be making sweet grade school memories together. The program can best and most accurately be evaluated in its longtime home without the inevitable challenges and emotional toll moving to a new environment will create.

In having many conversations recently on the topic with various community members, both those closely involved and others with no potential impact to them, a universal question arises concerning how quickly the school can be ramped up as a solely French immersion school, if ever. Aside from splitting our children apart, one of our biggest concerns about the current recommendation surrounds our daughter, who will be left alone in the French program at what we are all terrified will essentially be a shell of a school with significantly reduced extracurricular programs and parental support for some time to come. It will take years to adequately build up the French program - if it is even possible - if for no other reason then, because it can only be joined in the early grades. The school shares little in common with Dos Mundos, which clearly benefited from its existing surrounding immersion programs and the many native-speaking local residents who were able to enter at any program grade.

Please, please leave the ALC program at Morningside, if only temporarily, to give adequate time for the program study and for the expanded French program to grow to meaningful numbers. It would mean so very much to our family and to many others’ to slow down and be given the time to do this in a more sufficiently evaluated way.

I'm sure I'd be as upset or more than the Eastwood parents if the decision had been made to close Oakridge, but I will say I think the district has made difficult but good and informed decision.  

I think delaying the decision would be a mistake as the schools have already realized impacts from declining enrollment that will only continue to get worse.  This decision probably is a few years too late already.

Aside from the points you've already shared, here is what I see as some impacts to the combined boundaries for Oakridge/Eastwood.

1) Proximity to Churchill - for parents of multiple children, I see many kids walk from Churchill to Oakridge to meet up with their younger siblings at pickup.  That isn't possible for Eastwood Elementary and is a benefit to families to keeping Oakridge open.
2) Students from Emigration would be bused to either school, and doesn't seem to me to be a big impact to those in boundary students to route to Oakridge instead. Adding busing for current Eastwood students I think is an important consideration as well especially considering Wasatch Blvd is not exactly a very safe/walkable street.  I also like keeping the Eastwood students together in whatever move is made for friendships, siblings, etc.
3) Oakridge has lost many programs since my kids were there with a larger student body and more active PTA.  We used to have before school clubs like Spanish/French/Chess, etc. The events were far better attended such as Art Night, Dance Informances, School Carnivals, etc.  Those types of offering I'm guessing have also been lost over time as Eastwood lost population.  Both student populations will hopefully benefit from improved offerings and a larger more active PTA.  Should be a benefit to both former Eastwood & Oakridge students.
4) Classes per grade, class size, and options.  I know current Oakridge parents have had a very difficult time trying to get their students into the right class/teacher when there are so limited choices.  Getting the school population back to a more optimal 3 classes per grade is very important and I'm glad to see this hopefully being a benefit to Oakridge/Eastwood students and parents.
5) Afterschool care options for working families.  Oakridge had limited choices for afterschool pickup for daycare, having a larger student population means daycare centers are more incentivized to offer these programs to our school - improving parents choices.  I would suggest the district consider an aftercare program here as many parents in the neighborhood are working professionals who need reliable afterschool care.  If they can't find it, they have the resources and they will go private.
6) Neighborhood traffic - Eastwood was directly on Wasatch Blvd, a very busy street and we will now be doubling traffic into a fully residential area.  While I think the more residential area is better for elementary school students,  I'd encourage Granite to partner with Millcreek City for early and frequent enforcement of speed limits, safe drop-off/pick-up routes to set a new norm if the proposed closer is put in place.  The corner of Oakridge and Jupiter already experiences a fair amount of speeding and running of stop signs, so ensuring our students stay safe at that intersection needs to be reinforced with the heavier traffic flow.
7) Eastwood building/property.  I'm sure many residents are very concerned about what happens here.  There are rumors already of a park/fire station.  It would be good to come out and state if those rumors are true or just and idea or completely false.  If true, might be a relief vs. rumors of selling to developers.  If it isn't true, would be good to put it to bed.  We do need more green space in Millcreek, soccer fields, sledding hills, etc. - and that would be an awesome location to formalize into a city park.
8) Concerns about closing Eastwood & Morningside, two Skyline feeders is a bit of a bummer.  I know the owners of the house I live in previously chose to send their kids to Eastwood, which gave choice to people in Olympus Cove.  Narrowing to a single school in the Cove appears necessary but does limit choice of the only semi walkable schools in the area. I do hope Morningside as a French program only will increase attendance from out of bounds and I do support the idea.  I hope it will continue to be a great feeder school to Skyline.
9) Splitting the district.  I strongly oppose this idea as I see it as a further divide in equity that Salt Lake City already has in it's East/West divide.  While it does seem like we should have equal representation on the board, I do not support the idea that we pool wealthier Eastside resources at the expense of the rest of our community.  This is a public school district.  If residents want private school resources and experiences, those options are already there for them.  My kids have loved the GTI, and being able to get out of their East side bubble into a more diverse experience has been very positive for us.  I do support continued efforts by Granite and other public school advocates to make sure our legislature is held accountable to resources they are using that weaken our public school such as vouchers.

9/26/2025 15:01:11,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Olympus,Morningside Closure,"I am writing to urge you to preserve all (3) school tracks (Traditional, DLI, and ALC) at Morningside Elementary — a thriving, centrally located school that embodies stability, equity, and excellence within the GSD system. Any effort to disrupt or eliminate this school threatens to undermine the very strengths that make Morningside a cornerstone of the GSD community.
Here’s why Morningside must be protected:
        1. Exceptional Location and Accessibility: Morningside’s central location and streamlined pickup and drop-off systems make it one of the most accessible schools in the district, a vital attribute for working families and caregivers navigating daily commutes.
        2. Strong and Stable Enrollment: With the 2nd highest enrollment and a rising trend, Morningside is not a school in decline. It’s a school in demand because of its diverse offering. Slashing this momentum contradicts GSD’s goals of sustainability and growth.
        3. Unified, Inclusive School Community: Morningside is one of the few schools where all three tracks work cohesively — Traditional, French, and ALC, without dividing families. This unity fosters cross-cultural relationships, strengthens school culture, and reflects the values of inclusion and equity.
        4. Top Academic Performance: Morningside consistently ranks among the top schools in GSD, a direct result of its dedicated educators, engaged families, and balanced program offerings. Altering its structure jeopardizes hard-earned student outcomes.
        5. A Call for a Thoughtful Pause, Not Hasty Closures: We strongly urge the board to pause before making irreversible decisions. Rushing to close or radically change two schools in the same neighborhood — potentially displacing close to 1,000 students — is not a path to equity. It’s a recipe for community disruption and long-term harm and could push families out of the district and seeking other alternatives.
        6. Consolidation Plan Undermines Itself: The current proposal would gut Morningside’s Traditional and ALC tracks — slashing enrollment from 90% to a projected 40% by limiting it to French immersion only. This directly contradicts the PAC’s own consolidation goals of efficiency and strong enrollment.
        7. Community Integrity at Risk: Proposals to open Morningside’s doors to significant out-of-district enrollment in order to backfill cuts are not legitimate solutions. They sidestep the core issue: this school is already working — for our neighborhood and our children.

We are not opposed to responsible reform. But closing high-performing, well-enrolled, and centrally located schools like Morningside’s when the fundamental goal of the study was to increase school population, without fully exploring better alternatives and reviewing the facts, is a decision that will ripple for generations.

[Identifying information removed] The sense of security, mental health, and emotional well-being of our children must be a top priority in any decision-making process. Constant change is taking a toll. Please allow our children the stability they deserve and to finish elementary school with the friends and teachers who have supported them through these early educational years.

We respectfully request that the GSD Board halt the proposed changes for at least one year, and engage in meaningful collaboration with the community to find thoughtful, long-term solutions.

Let’s protect what’s working. Let’s keep Morningside whole."

Eastwood El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, Eastwood Closure","I am writing to respectfully request that you pause the Area 5 PAC study and allow Eastwood Elementary the chance to demonstrate its unique strengths and potential.

Eastwood offers something rare and deeply valuable: a smaller school environment where every staff member knows each child by name. This level of personal connection fosters a sense of belonging, safety, and accountability that cannot easily be replicated in larger schools. It is no surprise that Eastwood’s attrition rates are significantly lower than at larger schools such as Oakridge—families stay because of the warm, welcoming environment that helps every child thrive.

The proposed move to Oakridge raises serious concerns. The walk to Oakridge is dangerous, and the surrounding neighborhood cannot safely accommodate the multiple buses it would take to transport Eastwood students there. Our children, who flourish in a small, caring environment, risk being lost among the larger student body and higher turnover that Oakridge experiences.

With the addition of our new principal, Eastwood has already begun expanding opportunities for students by introducing choir, orchestra, and an art club as after-school programs. These offerings, combined with Eastwood’s Gold STEM status, position the school to grow into a full STEAM school with the potential addition of an Accelerated Learning Program, IB  program or expanded arts integration. Families are excited about these changes, and we are confident they will attract more students. In fact, the media attention surrounding our community’s fight to preserve Eastwood has only raised awareness of the school’s strengths—an opportunity the District could use to its advantage.

Taxpayers and families are watching closely to see whether the Board is willing to listen to its communities. Closing Eastwood would be a mistake with long-lasting consequences, but pausing now provides the chance to create a success story—one that honors the voices of parents, supports students, and strengthens the entire district.

We urge you to pause the PAC study and give Eastwood the opportunity to prove what we know it can become."

Eastwood El,Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"We have two children that we take to Eastwood purposefully while living out of the boundary. The make up of the school student body (pulling from 20+ zip codes), the excellent teachers, and the location in relation to our home and jobs make it unable to be replaced by any other school. There is a high probability we will be taking both our students out of the Granite district if Eastwood closes. "

Eastwood El,Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"I’m concerned with the lack of research conducted to support the conclusion the PAC has come to. There has been zero research on student and teacher attrition, traffic congestion at Oakridge and Eastwood, maintaining Eastwood’s Gold STEM designation, and safe walking routes (to name a few). Eastwood is an incredibly successful school with the data to prove it but the PAC continues to gaslight the community and maintains that we have too much going against us. Eastwood has a ramp to make it ADA compliant, our parking lot can accommodate more cars than oakridge, our capacity is the same, and we have a gold STEM program. Furthermore, some of the schools that requested help (ie upland terrace) have not been impacted at all. How is closing Eastwood (a school that did not request assistance) helping the students in that community? It would appear that Granite isn’t putting any kids first in this decision and it’s crucial that we hold them accountable for their lack of transparency."

Churchill Jr",Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"Bring the ALC program to Eastwood. Closing Eastwood weakens Granite District. It pushes working parents who rely on after school care pickup out of the district. This isn’t offered at any other granite elementary. You lose all the out of boundary students we have from Salt Lake District. I refuse to drive my student up those steep roads to Oakridge-especially in winter. There are higher rated schools in salt Lake District that are just as close and easier to get to. It makes no sense to close a top ten, gold stem school with the highest attendance rates and the lowest attrition rates for a school with the HIGHEST attrition rates and isn’t even a top ranked school. What in the world are you thinking. Eastwood drop off and pickup is not more challenging than Oakridge. Get some community input and do some traffic studies. Eastwood drop off might not be perfect but at least it is safe, the same can’t be said for Oakridge in the winter. Have you talked to the bus driver? Literally the only thing driving this decision is the in-bound student population number. More likely, it’s the property value. I know the firm that conducted an easement study for a fire station and housing and yet the district denies knowing anything about this. It’s no wonder public trust has been absolutely decimated. Cottonwood Elementary publicly voiced wanting this study, they expressed their teachers feeling over burdened. How does closing the only school that said they didn’t feel over burdened help those who are? This is the worst solution. Granite will continue to lose students, but it will significantly increase if Eastwood closes. And the district will be needing to do this study in area 5 again in 3-5 years. I seriously question how influenced this committee has been by Julie Jackson. Do you know her involvement at Berkstrand Associates, a property developer? Do you know that Steve Hogan sits on the Real Estate board for Granite District. Do you know that Karyn Winder’s spouse is married to the city manager of Millcreek. The District denies any knowledge of the easement study to lease the property for a fire station and housing that has been conducted by AJC architecture firm in the last year. We in the Eastwood community know that this decision was made before the study was initiated. It’s a sham. Let the district split, Granite lies. Granite does not have the best interest on the kids in mind."

Skyline High",Skyline,"The ALC Program, Eastwood Closure, Morningside Closure","After the September 22 and 23 meetings it was very clear that the PAC study is missing supportive data and the decision to close any school requires more careful examination. I urge you to pause the PAC study to consider crucial factors impacting students and communities. 
Particular concerns include transportation of Eastwood students to oakridge (no safe walking routes and traffic issues on steep blind curve hills), elimination of Eastwoods Gold Stem status (which cannot be transferred to another school- Julie Jackson lead us to believe it could when in fact it cannot). Why would anyone close a TOP RANKED school in the state? We are a thriving school community. Closing Eastwood would drive most Eastwood students away from granite to salt lake and canyons districts and charter schools. If the district is trying to attract students from other districts with special programs why are you recommending we close a school that ALREADY brings in a high percentage from other areas? Please let the Eastwood community be a beacon to the rest of the district to show how to build a strong community with high academic achievement. Julie Jackson failed to speak with our PTA and teachers prior to beginning the PAC study and only presented concerns she herself was aware of and made assumptions about Eastwood. Why not move the ALC program to Eastwood as this would offer a convenient drop off for commuting parents? Eastwoods accessibility to commuters is unmatched and would make sense bringing kids for ALC who would eventually feed into skyline. Closing Eastwood and Morningside would negatively impact the feeder patterns to Churchill. Why were none of the Olympus track schools recommended to close and both schools recommended for closure are skyline schools? There seems to be a bias toward Olympus over skyline. There also is conflicting evidence of whether or not the district has plans to lease eastwood’s high value property. Ben horsely has made conflicting statements about plans for the land and this brings into question the true motives for closing Eastwood as it has been said to  have the highest property value in the entire district. 
Furthermore the demographic data used for the PAC study does not reflect the specific demographics of the Eastwood neighborhood. For example the turnover of homes in the neighborhood from older people to young families was not considered. (Steve says each family would need to have 4-6 children but the growing population in the neighborhood combined with Eastwoods commuters would be enough to fill the school). The number of children on my Eastwood neighborhood street has at least TRIPLED since 2020 and Granite District would be foolish to close Eastwood as given 1-2 more years these children will be school age. If Eastwood closes, the majority of these families will choose salt Lake District or charter schools due to our desire for a more diverse school population and strong community. (I have spoken firsthand to many parents of Eastwood neighborhood toddlers who moved here specifically for Eastwoods unique culture and strong academics and they believe they will not find this at oakridge based on a number of factors). Closing Eastwood would drive families away from the neighborhood and further decrease granite districts enrollment. Imagine what keeping Eastwood open would look like just a few years from now! It makes no sense to close a thriving top ranked gold stem school with high commuter accessibility which borders salt Lake and Summit school districts. 
Please reconsider your recommendations and PAUSE THE PAC in order to better understand the issues and don’t settle for permanent solutions to temporary problems. It’s not too late to vote against these recommendations and provide real concrete meaningful data before disrupting thriving school communities. Keep Granites only gold stem school open!

Skyline High",Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"Eastwood is not a small struggling school. Elementary schools do not need to have 600 pupils to be viable. It does not need to be rebuilt although some investment has been withheld and is needed for sure. For generations it has been the hub of a thriving neighborhood community and has also attracted and welcomed students from surrounding areas.
Uncertainty and neglect has recently been encouraged and used to shape a misleading and unnecessary narrative that the school may need to close.
It absolutely does not need to be this way and the best interests of the Eastwood pupils, their families and wider community have not been at the centre of Granite school district’s opportunistic, strategic planning in this respect.
Please listen now.
The taxes of these families and this neighborhood justify and legitimize the fiscal or business case so to speak for keeping Eastwood open for their children. It may be advantageous to attract a few more students to balance out class sizes etc. There are very straightforward and effective ways to encourage that.
It is not necessary to impose a granite school district 600 pupil elementary school blueprint. One size does not fit all. 
It is not ok for you to take this away.  "

I have attended nearly every meeting and tried in good faith to understand the challenges presented. When you told us you wanted creative solutions and that nothing had been decided, I believed you. But what I’ve seen instead is a process driven by bias, flawed data, and predetermined outcomes.

 Beyond questionable data, I take issue with the narrative that the only problem is declining enrollment. That is true nationwide—but here, the larger issue is that Granite is failing to remain competitive while alternatives are drawing thousands of students away.

I believe strongly in public education, but if families don’t see Granite as a viable option, they will leave. Instead of treating parents as allies, you’ve pitted school against school, community against community. That is not leadership.

Rather than closing schools to treat the symptoms, we need to address the root causes: high class sizes, aging buildings, inadequate support for teachers, and lack of investment. The time, money, and political energy spent on closures could have been spent fighting for better resources at the state level. You are the largest district in Utah—our children depend on you to advocate for them.

These are our schools, our communities. If Granite cannot or will not defend them, then perhaps we need leaders who will. And Unless Granite changes course, we’ll be back here in a few years with the same conversation, only now with middle schools at risk."

Eastwood El,Skyline,"A Boundary Change, Eastwood Closure, Other","While I do not disagree with the data and analysis of declining enrollment, I believe this PAC and its recommendation for closures have been rushed and are not driven by data about what is best for the children within the PAC study's boundary. 

The PAC has not provided transparent data or details to justify its recommendations or decisions. The data provided to the community has been consistently unfounded, biased, or excluded key data that would change the data points Granite School claims. For example:
- Not including the Immigration Canyon students and the boundary area they add to Eastwood. 
- Inaccurate class size numbers for Eastwood were presented multiple times.
- Evidence for closure is one-sided and does not include feedback from Eastwood or other schools impacted by the recommendation.  

My ask would be that the PAC halt its efforts for this year, study the data, and engage the community. This has not been done, and our area representative (Julie Jackson) has not engaged our community in a truly representative manner. She has shown considerable bias against Eastwood since before the PAC started and has fought for our closure without even engaging with our community. 

Given the lack of clear, comprehensive data to justify such a significant decision, I believe this recommendation is rushed and not justified, especially in light of Eastwood being a top 10 school in the state and a gold-standard STEM school. Eastwood has consistently demonstrated exceptional performance compared to both district and state averages. Despite its smaller capacity, the school excels academically, supported by a highly engaged staff and a uniquely invested community.

Any proposal to close a school must be rooted in transparent, evidence-based reasoning. In the case of Eastwood, no sufficient data has been provided to show that closure would benefit students, families, or the broader district. Instead, what we see is a thriving school environment that outperforms many surrounding schools and fosters strong community partnerships.

Closing Eastwood without solid justification undermines trust in the process and disregards the proven success of a school that has become a cornerstone for its students and community."

For all the positives that Eastwood has, why would you close it just because it has low in bound numbers? That is insane. It brings in so many students from out of boundary. And if the district actually invested in it, it would bring in even more. We are nearly 2 miles from the next closest school, we sit on the boundary, we have a canyon separating us from Oakridge, everyone has heard awful things about the principal at Oakridge by the way-nobody in the neighborhood is going to  transfer to Oakridge. You will lose so many students over this and your problem still won’t be solved-it will be worse. Oakridge might get some new students but it won’t be enough for another class so the teachers will be even more stretched and Oakridge attrition will get even worse. Those rich parents in south cove will just send their kids to private school when they see how big the classes get. You won’t just be closing Eastwood, you will erase an entire student population. Has nobody assessed the risk of this recommendation? The parents who spoke and offered better ideas spoke like experts in their field while the district just seems to point to birth rate over and over and how nobody can afford to move here. Guess what, every time a house goes up for sale in our neighborhood, it gets sold, and guess who moves in? Families with kid almost every time. If the problem is affordability, why is that. You don’t know our neighborhood.  And stop harping on “nobody is having 4 or 5 kids anymore, we can’t keep this school here anymore”  That is the dumbest argument that I’ve heard of and just goes to show the lack of desire for the district to solve the problem. Stop looking to the past and start thinking modern. Modern problems deserve modern solutions. Start looking at it with a fresh lens and a desire to do what’s best for our students. I’ve compared the study to other districts by the way and granite’s looks clumsy by comparison. 
 We can all see the conflicts of interest here and the way you are valuing Eastwood’s property over our kids while saying you have had no talks or plans for our property.We don’t trust you at all and we are angry. I don’t even know if I want my kids to attend skyline I’m so upset. "

9/27/2025 10:32:04,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,"4. Eastwood El, 11. Churchill Jr",Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"The recommended Eastwood closure does not make sense from any objective measure.  EW has the best overall ranking (10th in the State according to U.S. News) and is one of only four Gold STEM elementary schools in the state.  This is a designation that cannot be transferred and also requires longevity in the program so it cannot be easily acquired by other schools.  

Eastwood has the highest attendance and lowest student attrition rates (only 2% or 34 kids over a 7-year period).  In comparison, Oakridge has more than twice the district average in student attrition (6% and 135 kids in the same 7-year period).  Similarly, Eastwood has really high teacher retention rates (68%, with teachers leaving only to retire, because they were surplussed, or to move out of state in the last 12 years).  In comparison, Oakridge's retention rate is 41%.  I does not make sense to send students from a school where students and teachers stay to a school that is hemorrhaging students and teachers if your goal is to keep students in the district.

Eastwood is more centrally located within the combined boundaries.  Any contention to the contrary ignores that Emigration Canyon is part of the boundary.  As one of the highest tax bases in the district, alienating Emigration parents and leaving them with much better options in the Salt Lake School District risks both a mass exodus of students from GSD, but also that Emigration Canyon will seek to be formally moved to Salt Lake School District.  Emigration parents have already begun exploring this option.  Why would we want our tax dollars to go to a school district other than where the majority of our students attend?  

Eastwood attracts most more out-of-district and out-of-boundary kids than Oakridge and is best positioned to attract the most out-of-district students than any other school in the Granite School District.  At the Monday meeting, Steve Hogan said that GSD does not like to shut down schools on the edge of its boundary because it is too easy to lose the students at those schools to other districts.  This same logic applies to Eastwood.  All of the families who are already choosing to commute from out-of-district to Eastwood will go elsewhere.  So will many of the in-boundary parents who are much closer to Salt Lake District schools than Oakridge.

I have already made comments about how unsafe the walk is from Eastwood to Oakridge.  There are only two routes and neither of them is safe nor can they be made safe.  The first walk is at least 1.5 miles along Wasatch Blvd.  It crosses at least three busy intersections and 5 business entrances.  It also includes a significant elevation gain.  That is the only option that has sidewalks for most of the walk.  Cars buzz along Wasatch between 40-50 mph and it is unrealistic to believe that Millcreek will turn that entire section of busy road to 20 mph school zone.  It is also not economically feasible or possible to have crossing guards at all of the intersections and business entrances.  The second option is even less safe.  It involves a blind curve with no sidewalks, an uneven 4-way stop along a busy canyon road, an area with significant history of accidents (they have a sign that warns of blind driveways), and a long walk along busy, sidewalkless Jupiter Drive.  This walk includes a 250 foot elevation drop and gain in half a mile that most adults would have doing every day, two ways.  

When I raised this at the public meeting, the reaction was, ""none of our kids are safe.""  This response is morally reprehensible on so many levels.  If one set of parents thinks that their walk to school is unsafe, their response should not be ""your kids should have unsafe routes too.""  The response should be that we should be making choices that make everyone's walks safer.  

The bussing situation is also hazardous.  As I have previously mentioned, Emigration Canyon parents already have students getting on the bus at 6:10 a.m. and arriving home at 4:10 p.m.   Any suggestion of extending this 10-hour day for parents who already have kids waiting on the bus for hours at a time or of getting a bus for a different area that doesn't address this problem is only going to further anger and alienate Emigration Canyon parents and hasten their efforts to break from GSD.  Also, is makes no financial sense to spend $440,000 to bus kids away from their school when that is almost the same supposed cost savings of shutting down the school.  That also does not include the significant cost to the district of losing Emigration Canyon's tax dollars in perpetuity when they break from GSD.

The argument that GSD has to shut down schools or the legislature will is a straw man argument.  The legislature stepped in to close SLSD schools 1 time in 19 years.  GSD has shut down 10 schools in 7 years.  I'd rather be in a district that shuts down schools slowly and thoughtfully with pressure from the legislature than one that does it quickly, without careful thought voluntarily and repeatedly.

GSD has repeatedly stated that the primary objective of the recommended closure is to improve teacher resources, but it doesn't appear to have done any actually studies to determine whether closing schools actually accomplishes this objective or whether it will accomplish such objective in this situation.  With the other schools GSD has closed, most students have left, with the few who have stayed only being enough to increase the strain on teacher resources--bigger classes, but not enough to result in the allocation of additional teachers.  Classes of 30+ students will hasten the exodus from those schools.  This is even more true with an EW closure where so many students are already out-of-district, out-of-boundary, and closer to the SLSD, charter, and private schools.  

Closing Eastwood does not make sense and doing so will permanently and negatively impact Granite School District for generations.    "

For example, moving ALC and all or some of the MSide boundary kids to EW would allow the district to maintain its academically successful programs and maintain its Gold STEM certification at a location that is in the prime location to attract out-of-district students and compete with Charter Schools and improve teacher resources and utilization scores.  This eliminates the unsafe walking routes and minimizes the hazardous bussing situation.

Closing Eastwood and Morningside will have a direct affect on the Skyline network, while the Olympus network has no current change. Eastwood is already one of the main schools that brings in students from outside the district/boundary to the skyline network. The skyline network depends on this to keep their numbers up. Reducing the number of schools that feed to Skyline will directly impact Skyline. With changes like shutting down schools, students leave the district and do not always follow the outlined plan. The feeder into the Jr Highs also needs to be looked at. Rosecrest should fully feed into the skyline network. Lastly, I think we need to reevaluate closing Eastwood. The commute up to Oakridge is difficult especially in the snow.  It would be better to shut down Morningside altogether (because there is no way you can fully fill a DLI magnet school and recruit 10 more French teachers right away). The French DLI should go to Oakridge. Oakridge would then have a traditional track and a dli track. Eastwood could take the ALC and have ALC and traditional track. This would balance out the students and not hurt the skyline network and cause the least disruption overall. By closing a school like Eastwood in a prime location and with high test scores, the district stands to lose the best feeder into skyline and this will hurt the skyline network. "

Morningside El,Skyline,"The DLI Program, Morningside Closure","I am writing to share concerns about the feasibility of the proposed French Dual Language Immersion (DLI) program. I understand the desire to expand language opportunities for Granite students, but I urge the Board to consider whether the evidence truly supports the program’s long-term viability.

One of the main justifications given for the French DLI program has been the perceived “wild success” of Dos Mundos Academy. However, Dos Mundos only opened its doors this year (2025–26). It therefore has no proven track record of growth, stability, or long-term success. Moreover, the enrollment numbers at Dos Mundos do not reflect organic new growth. Instead, they came directly from the consolidation of three pre-existing Spanish DLI programs:
	•	Hillsdale: 131 students in DLI
	•	Monroe: 267 students in DLI
	•	Valley Crest: 249 students in DLI

Together, this population of about 647 students was redistributed, not newly generated, to form Dos Mundos. While the district may currently be counting around 450 students at Dos Mundos, this figure is not surprising given the consolidation. It does not, however, demonstrate that demand for DLI is expanding or that a new French program will achieve similar results.

It is also important to note that Spanish differs significantly from French in our district. Many of the Spanish DLI students come from homes where Spanish is spoken, either as a first or second language. This provides a cultural and linguistic foundation that helps sustain Spanish DLI enrollment and strengthens the program. In contrast, French has no similar community support base in Granite. To assume that a French program will mirror Spanish DLI’s numbers is to overlook these critical demographic differences.

I respectfully ask the Board to reconsider whether a French DLI program is the best use of district resources at this time. A careful analysis of actual demand, sustainability, and equity in program placement should guide this decision—not the assumption that what works for Spanish DLI will automatically work for French.

Thank you for your time and consideration."

Morningside El,Skyline,"Eastwood Closure, Morningside Closure","A practical idea to support Emigration Canyon families and strengthen Morningside’s traditional enrollment: Consider rezoning prior Emigration Canyon Eastwood families to Morningside instead of Oakridge. Their primary concern is the early bus pickup required to reach Oakridge from Emigration Canyon. Morningside’s later start time would allow for a more reasonable bus schedule, reducing the need for early wake-ups and shortening commute times in both directions. This will also help prevent overcrowding at Oakridge, another concern of Eastwood/Oakridge families. 

From a geographic standpoint, none of the current school options are particularly convenient from Emigration Canyon. Given that, it makes sense to prioritize a placement that better aligns with their daily routines and minimizes transportation burdens. Morningside offers that opportunity for Emigration families."

Please consider these proposals to address the problem: 

Zone more students to our school. We want the PAC to zone all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive to Cottonwood Elementary. The PAC’s current plan splits the population in this area among three different schools, giving Driggs enough students for approximately 3.5 classes per grade, Oakwood 3.5 classes/grade, and Cottonwood 2.5 classes/grade. We need a more equitable split. Rezoning all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive would potentially yield us 220 new students, giving each school approximately 3 classes/grade. Per state law, re-zoned students have the opportunity to special permit back into their previous school, so we will likely only get a fraction of the 100 students the PAC is currently re-zoning to us.

Close Morningside Elementary; Send Dual-Language Immersion (DLI) program to Driggs. The PAC’s current plan “closes” Morningside Elementary, but keeps it open as a French DLI-only school. There are not enough students in the Skyline and Olympus networks to support eight elementary schools at 3 classes/grade. Making a DLI-only school leaves both the new French school and Cottonwood Elementary under enrolled. Moving DLI to Driggs bolsters the population of both Driggs and Cottonwood Elementary by combining the populations of three schools into two.

Send Morningside’s ALC (gifted) program to Cottonwood: The PAC is currently looking for a new home for Morningside’s ALC program. As the top-scoring elementary school in our district, the ALC is a good culture fit at our school and would be attractive to high-performing families. Having the gifted program would benefit our school by attracting siblings of ALC students and waitlisted ALC students, retaining zoned students who leave for the ALC program, and by having more teachers in the building to share the workload."

I chose the French program at Morningside without speaking French myself and not knowing how my child would take to it.  Having a traditional program let me have the confidence knowing that if he struggled in a new language but loved Morningside, he could still stay.  Many families feel the same and want the opportunity to transfer programs without uprooting their child's lives.  This also gives families the opportunity to have siblings in and out of the French program at the same school.  Please consider building up the traditional program to have two solid classes in each grade.  Consider mixing the French ELA classes with traditional ELA Classes so that it doesn't feel like separate programs.  Families will not stay if they do not have traditional classes.  It has been said that Penn asked to become a Spanish only immersion and they were told no, not unless the traditional families were fighting for it.  Why is Morningside forced into this option?  It is not something the traditional families or the DLI families want.

I also wonder why this is the only proposed option when it does not fix enrollment issues at so many of the other schools?  This proposal seems like it was not thought out.  It only closes one building (Eastwood) and then takes Morningside to 50%.  It is expensive to pay the staff that need to be there (office, lunch, custodial, admin) for 50% of a building.

On Monday, September 29, I listened to a broadcast on NPR, called “The Daily,” which is powered by New York Times journalism.  The broadcast essentially pointed to the fact that while a generation of American students have been told that a computer science degree would yield a well paying job, that may no longer be the case.  Students who are now being recruited, are the ones who have been trained in AI coding. (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/podcasts/the-daily/big-tech-told-kids-to-code-the-jobs-didnt-follow.html) After clicking on the link, click “transcript.” 
 
The current ubiquitous presence of AI in the world suggests an idea for keeping Eastwood Elementary open.  Add an AI element to the Technology component of the Gold STEM school status that Eastwood already has.  If parents and students knew that students could begin to understand AI coding at Eastwood Elementary, I think that would be a magnet for new student enrollment – especially if the new offering was well promoted.  
 
“The Daily” broadcast also mentioned that both Microsoft and Google are offering grants to schools to help them implement education in AI coding.  If GSD has a good grant writer, perhaps AI could be added to the curriculum without a financial investment. 
 
I am sure that proposing the closure of any GSD school is painful for all involved – GSD and the community of people who highly value their neighborhood school.   But, I am also sure that if a school could be saved by the prospect of a magnetic new program, it would be a win-win for GSD and the school community.  I think this idea bears exploration.   
 
Please pause your closure process while you consider innovative ideas for increasing school population.

Morningside El,Skyline,The DLI Program,"- Morningside currently has a robust student population and therefore funding has allowed for a great team of support staff. Although the concept of a French DLI only school sounds great, my concern is that the initial, and possibly prolonged, smaller number of students enrolled will not be able to fund enough support staff to have maintain how well Morningside functions now. 

- From what I understand all day preschools and daycare are hard to find in our area. More and more families are needing dual incomes to navigate the economy. Adding a paid all day preschool option to the Morningside DLI school building could serve as a great feeder into the K-5 program. The preschool could be French as well. Is it possible to obtain state, district or federal funds that could supplement the cost for an all day preschool/childcare program at Morningside? 

- I feel that ‘Morningside’ should somehow remain in the name of the school as the school has a strong reputation in the DLI space and would take years or significant marketing costs to regain that ground. 

- Our french program has great teachers that draw and keep students at our schools. PLEASE KEEP OUR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS! And make the transition to a ‘new’ school as painless as possible for them. Ideally not having to ‘rehire’ them. 

- The French program will likely only be as strong as its teachers’ reputations. There was a French teacher that remained employed for WAY too long at Churchill after many complaints from parents and students. Many kids dropped out due to their experience there and the effects trickled down to the elementary school enrollment numbers. As I understand it, there is currently a mediocre French teacher at Skyline high school. Because students don’t have multiple choices for teachers in a DLI program, the district needs to respond promptly to complaints about staff. 

- Foreign visas are increasingly difficult to obtain. If there is a way to structure Morningside school to make obtaining visas any easier? Like calling it a charter or magnet etc?

- Recruiting out of district students to the French program will take marketing money. Please set aside the financial  resources the school will need for marketing.

- Thank you for taking the time to read feedback. It’s difficult to try and navigate, our community appreciates all the efforts you have taken to understand the nuanced effects this study has on each student and family.  "

I have 2 children at Morningside in the ALC program, one at Wasatch, and one child starting kindergarten next year.  Respectfully, I have several questions and ideas that I haven't heard brought up concerning the Morningside closure that I urge you to consider:

- I am very concerned about the idea to make Morningside a stand alone French DLI school. It has been explained to us that you are using the all Spanish DLI school on the west side as evidence that this can work.  However, I think a vital piece of information that is needed to make this decision must be to interview parents of Morningside French DLI students to determine why they chose this program to begin with.  My question is, have you done this?  In my understanding, having had children at Morningside for 8 years now, many/most of our DLI parents choose the program out of convenience rather than true desire for the program. In other words, siblings are in the ALC program and it is a neat opportunity because they are at the school anyway or it is their neighborhood school and maybe one of their children has desire or aptitude for the program and the others may not- either way they let the one child join because - why not, their family is already there.  Another reason I have seen is they feel like the French program is slightly better than the traditional route.  In other words, my great concern is that the Morningside French DLI program will not exist without options for siblings and I feel like you really need to have some talks with the DLI parents to understand their reasons for attending.  I feel like the reasons will likely be completely different to the Spanish DLI school, which is a significantly more desirable language and many residents here in our state do speak Spanish and English already (much much more than French), making the Spanish DLI school more sensible.  You just cannot assume the same goes for French and with all due respect, I do not believe neighboring district residents will be jumping for the opportunity to send students to an all French school. If they aren't already lining up for the chance to be in the program, I do not feel like we can assume that ""if we build it, they will come.""  Knowing what I know about why families choose this program, it will not be successful and the school will close eventually. French DLI will not survive without at least a traditional component. I would argue that the 3 programs work as a type of ""opportunity synergy""  to bring families in.  In my opinion, we should fix the traditional classroom numbers problems and call this a model school and try to create other schools with as much ""opportunity synergy"".  I would love the opportunity, as a former teacher, to discuss ideas of fixing our classroom numbers in the traditional classrooms.  

-Morningside and its paths to Skyline, have a long and rich history of providing some of the best opportunities in public education that our district (and state even) can provide.  Why would we risk disassembling Morningside on the off chace that an all French DLI school can work? If feels counter productive in this instance.  I applaud GISD for trying to find new programs to start at schools(Arts at Rosecrest, Project-Based at Cottonwood, and Elementary IB at Oakridge or Eastwood).  I do feel like these programs are attractive to parents.  Why does GISD not want to give these new programs a try before we shut down any of our schools? These are all great schools and taxpayers make huge sacrifices to live where we do to have access to this community and its schools. Let's build them- grow them with these programs. Maybe a closure is not the answer at this time. Maybe creative solutions, which you have already begun to introduce are the solution. Why not expand these programs even further to include programs such as a hands-on/kinesthetic learning program for students who struggle with adhd or other programs which could really speak to those parents who are homeschooling right now because their children struggle in a traditional program. It also think there may be some creative programs that would appeal to families who are homeschooling.   I would be very happy to discuss ideas for that with you as well.  

Why not use the eastside schools as powerhouses of opportunity to draw people to the area and back to our schools.  Granite school district has an opportunity to be a hero or a zero on the east side right now.  I personally would like to see us continue to grow and not lose faith in the district.  There have to be other ways to cut costs and keep and grow these schools.  
Our schools are great, our communities are great. You have a lot of talented parents at some of these schools who would probably gladly volunteer to help brainstorm solutions.  But ultimately it feels like we need to look at more data and solutions before we shut down Morningside.  Let's give it more time and see if the community can work with GISD to solve some of these problems.  

Respectfully,
a very concerned parent

As a parent of an Eastwood student, I have watched closely the PAC process. After reviewing the recommendations, I am baffled. The school board is charged with the education of our students. So it is confusing why it would consider a recommendation to close one of the top schools in Utah. Out of over 600 elementary schools in Utah, a top 10 school should be celebrated, supported and learned from. Further, its designation as a Gold STEM school and the longevity of its teachers is a further testament to its strength. 
When we moved to this community, that was a strong factor in our choice.   Others agree. The data provided by the PAC demonstrates that more families in the Eastwood boundary proportionally choose their local school over enrolling in another option. 
A strong reason the board gave for moving forward with the PAC is declining enrollment. That is a truth. However, I would also like to see data on the projected growth in Area 5 communities. I suspect one reason for the recent decline in enrollment is the age of the  homeowners. This is such a fabulous community that people stay in their homes for many years. Our cul de sac is an example. When we moved into our house 9 years ago, all of the other families had adult children, most of whom had attended Eastwood as children. Now 2 more families with young children have moved in. This means in our small street of 9 houses, those with school aged children has increased by over 33%. Where will these children go if Eastwood closes?  Oakridge is not an equivalent option by educational standards, it is less convenient, and I suspect many in the Eastwood community will choose an alternative. 
Another part of the recommendation I question is to transition Morningside into a full DLI French school. Again, What data did the PAC use to determine that this is a viable or wanted option?  How many applications for the French DLI are turned away each year?  My suspicion is not nearly enough to justify an entire school. French in particular is not a language that should be considered, given that it is declining in popularity for  language learners. 
I strongly urge you to consider some of the suggested alternatives out forth by the Eastwood community. Transitioning DLI to Oakridge keeps that program intact while not over-committing resources to an unproven theory. 
Transitioning the ALC and moving boundaries to increase Eastwood expands the opportunities and impact of this top school to a greater number of students. In addition to being an Eastwood parent, I am also the parent to a Morningside ALC graduate who is now a student at Churchill, so I have a unique ability to speak to the strength of both Eastwood and the ALC. The unsupported suggestion by the PAC that the ALC is taking lower caliber students is not my lived experience. The ALC was a phenomenal resource for our high achieving child. Had it not been an option, we very likely would have considered private school alternatives to meet her needs. Combining Eastwood and the ALC would be a perfect marriage of two exceptional programs that would very likely attract many families. Alternatively, closure of Eastwood and expansion of the Morningside French DLI does not support our students education and spends an unreasonable proportion of resources on an unproven concept. 
By voting for the closure of Eastwood the board would be shutting down one of its top educational gems. Rather than increasing enrollment and attracting more students as the district has hoped, it sends a clear message that the district does not prioritize students or their education first. Rather, it raises into question the district priorities and will likely drive many families who previously would stay in public schools looking for other options. 

Thank you for your consideration,

10/6/2025 23:11:52,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,10. Upland Terrace El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, The DLI Program","Dear School Board Members:

I am a parent of 1 current and 1 future Upland Terrace Red Tail Hawk! We are having a wonderful experience in our first year at Upland Terrace, and I want to share that we actually moved homes earlier this year (from SL School District), in large part to ensure our kids could attend K-12 at Upland, Wasatch and Skyline. 

Hearing the possibility of an additional program, ALC, being thrown into Upland is worrisome. We have two amazing programs at Upland: our traditional program (with gifted clusters) and our Special Education (SPED) program. I am concerned that adding the ALC will negatively affect our students in these two wonderful programs for the below reasons:

1. Resources: 
In its proposed form, it will almost certainly take away from the resources dedicated to the majority of the student population. 
Above anything else, we should be certain that the learning environment - first and foremost, the teachers and classroom space - are adequate to take on this additional program. 
We should be open to “outside the box” ideas of what an ALC program looks like - segregation vs. integration, frequency of ALC implementation, only applying to certain subjects, only beginning at older ages. 
Upland did not receive additional programs after the last PAC study. Many ofour enrichment programs, such as Art and STEAM, are already run and executed by parents. I worry adding ALC would deny our ability to provide our traditional curriculum students with these much needed enrichments.
2. Culture: Upland is outstanding for its inclusive culture and community. I worry that adding an exclusive program, in which only a select sliver of students can join by passing a test with narrow parameters, would create a divisive “other” culture. 

3. Safety: Upland is the only school that is within walking distance of both the Junior High and High School, and many of our students, including my own family, walk or bike to and from school. I worry about the hazards caused by the increased car traffic from the commuting ALC students.

——————-
Other concerns about the boundary study process:
Learning more about the changes in the elementary boundaries and program brings to light an overall concern of too many specialty programs, leading to inadequate focus on ensuring majority of students (not in specialty programs) are receiving the proper resources

In an ideal world, all programs could exist, but we are operating under constraints, many of which I described above, such as locational constraints, real estate / classrooms space, teachers, and budget.

1. DLI: I cannot speak to the French DLI program, but I think we should be very careful about prioritizing a DLI program in the midst of school reorganization. I know that DLI programs are very en vogue in the moment, but are there proven outcomes that DLI programs are effective?

2. ALC: I can speak to my own experiences in a program similar to an ALC program:

I do not attribute any of my academic success or career success to my experience in ALC. I was in a school district that provided other advanced learning opportunities as I grew older and prepared me for academic success at the university level. 
My own personal experience in a “gifted and talented” program aligns with several credible bodies of research conclude no meaningful difference in student outcomes. There is a wide range similar to the majority of students. 
The testing methodology to enter the ALC program can be quite flawed, especially at younger ages.
My final parting thought is - how can we ensure that we are going through the difficult process now in order to invest in a well-functioning district with plenty of resources for years to come, instead of re-visiting this whole process within the next few years. There is going to be no single outcome that fits all interests, but it is within all stakeholders interests to provide certainty for years to come. 

Thank you,

From my view it makes more sense that if morningside is being closed to have the ALC program move to a more central location within the Skyline network.  Eastwood is on the northeast bench and has the most difficulty drop off and pick up which makes it more difficult for buses and family traveling without granite to get this this school.  Either Oakridge or Upland Terrace would make more sense as an ALC school.  

I think it makes more sense to close either Oakridge or Eastwood as compared to closing Morningside
1)	Both Oakrdige and Eastwood schools are located in the highest real estate value areas and have the highest decreasing enrollment historically.  They are unlikely to grow traditional students in this region.  Closing one and consolidating while potentially adding ALC or DLI makes either of these school more survivable in the long run.  
2)	Morningside has a long history of success with the DLI and ALC programs so it makes more sense to keep one of these programs at Morningside alongside a traditional program rather than re-inventing the wheel and moving the programs all to a different school.

I believe that moving the DLI program to Oakwood will not benefit the school, and over time will actually be detrimental to the traditional students, as was also seen at Millcreek Elementary. For example, having only one traditional class for every grade limited teacher collaboration and forced the same students to be in class together every year. If there were students that needed to be separated for any reason this was not possible because a student could not be moved from the traditional class into the DLI class.

""Hi,

I watched the recording of tonight’s meeting. I have a second grader in the ALC at Morningside as well as a kindergartner whom we have been hoping will test into the ALC program. 

For those students who test into ALC, if the program is re-routed to Woodstock, would they continue to feed into Bonneville Junior High and Cottonwood High School? (Please correct me if this is incorrect; I found this information online). 

A big part of why we have chosen the ALC route was for our children to eventually attend Wasatch Junior High and Skyline High School-schools we considered and are rated as the best academic junior high and high school in the district. If that will no longer be the case, it seems like a step back in “preserving the fidelity” of the program meant to best serve the most academically gifted students in granite schools.  We are not going to pursue ALC if the route ends at Cottonwood High School. 


Additionally, I don’t understand the math involved in “preserving the fidelity” of the ALC program by narrowing it into two classes at one school rather than two classes at two schools (my understanding from the recording). This seems like a similar number of students.



If the scoring threshold changes by an unacceptable margin each year, that is what is unacceptable. An absolute lowest test score could simply be selected under which the position would no longer be offered. Of course, if you can’t fill the ALC program with a set threshold score, maybe the test is imperfect or maybe you have to allow for changes in the threshold knowing some families will not choose to have their high-scoring child matriculate into the ALC for various reasons. In my opinion, offering to a motivated student who is in the top 10% and wants to be involved seems better than an empty classroom, and doesn’t seem like it would negatively impact the fidelity of the program).

""Regarding the recommendation to close Eastwood.
Eastwood is a gateway into the district. Its location right by the freeway and its strong academic performance draw families who might not otherwise enroll here. Closing it is like shutting a main entrance—you’re not just losing one school, you’re cutting off an access point that brings students and resources into the district. Being in the corner of the district boundaries it really feels like you are chopping off the leg of a table so to speak and it is going to harm the whole district in the long run. The number projections for Oakridge seem to assume that all the families who commute to Eastwood will choose to transition to Oakridge. As a parent at Eastwood, I personally know many families who have said they will not make that switch and will likely leave the district for local charter schools that are easier to get to.
In addition, if I were a parent in the immigration canyon, I would not send my student on an even longer bus ride to oakridge, I would just enroll in a closer Salt Lake District school and I would likely petition to have the district boundary changed to allow immigration canyon into Salt Lake District so my students could ride on a reasonable bus ride.

""Hi Granite Schools Administrators,

My name [names removed] I have three children that will be in elementary school next year.  As parents, we donate significant time and money to Morningside.  Our oldest is in the ALC program at Morningside in 3rd grade.  She has had a wonderful experience.  We are hoping that our other two children will also test into the ALC experience in the next 2 years.  We value ALC because of the extra educational rigor this program requires.  

We believe the ALC option should be expanded rather than shrunk.  More children need a more rigorous educational experience, with higher expectations.  We are saddened to hear that Granite School District is considering shrinking the number of students who have the option for this program.  We ask that you please reconsider how this program might be expanded.  

In addition, it would help us and many of our neighbors if the ALC program could continue to be located in Area 5, at Upland, Driggs, or Oakridge, for example.  That makes neighborhood friendships and travel logistics much easier.

If needed, we may be open to donating additional resources to help expand ALC and keep it in Area 5.

We look forward to hearing from you.  Please add anything missed [name removed]

""Hello, 

My name is [Name removed] and I am a parent to an Eastwood student living in Emigration Canyon. I have voiced this sentiment many times, but I know myself and other parents share a deep concern at the lack of acknowledgment and consideration of the Emigration Canyons students. This is showed through even the lack of transparency of including the full pictures on the boundary maps to include our area (instead of just an arrow pointing away and saying emigration canyon). Currently, Eastwood kids living in higher Emigration oaks are bussing an hour on a good weather day. To say Oakridge is more centrally located is a lie that’s easy to perpetuate when you intentionally mislead the public by not including the canyon kids or any images/slides with data including Emigration canyon as apart of the boundary images as a whole and the data in addition. These closures would add significant bussing times on students who already bussed far. I would appreciate to
see more inclusion, acknowledgement and consideration of Emigration canyon as a whole in this study. Thank you. """

""I'm writing to express my huge disappointment in the plan to move Morningside's ALC program to Woodstock Elementary. Though I'm sure Woodstock is a wonderful school, it feels like the ALC students in our area are being shown the least amount of concern in this plan. Moving a student away from their neighborhood school and into a special program is a huge decision that effects the whole family, but when my oldest daughter's needs were clearly not being met by her home school, I was open to moving her because at least Morningside was still in our area. Had our only option been to go miles away to Woodstock, I would have instead considered a private or charter school in our area. Have you considered families with siblings where one is in the ALC program and one is not? It was always an option to enroll a sibling in the mainstream program at Morningside, which felt reasonable again because the school was IN OUR AREA. I would never ask a sibling to follow another to Woodstock, taking them completely out of their neighborhood - which then splits up families. 

The French program is wonderful, and I'm glad it exists, but why does it feel like they are being given priority and spared any inconvenience when French is not filling an educational NEED, rather an interest? ALC students need this program in order to learn and thrive in an educational setting, so why are we the only ones being ""punished"" by being sent out of our area schools? You can't tell any of us that there isn't a demand for the ALC program - we know how many kids attempt to test in and are turned away. Why not make Morningside a French and ALC school, thus far more effectively utilizing the school (which is costing all of us money to keep open)? I've said all along that we'd follow the ALC program anywhere, but that was when I assumed that of course it would stay within Area 5. I have two more children who will be entering school in a few years, and if the ALC program is moved to Woodstock I can promise I'll be looking at other options rather than driving my kids so far away.

""Dear Members of the Granite School District Board and Recommending Committee,

I am writing as a parent of two students currently enrolled in the Advanced Learning Center (ALC) program (grades 3 and 1) to express my deep concern regarding the recent PAC recommendations to close Eastwood and Morningside Elementary Schools, relocate the ALC to Woodstock Elementary, and transition Morningside into a French Dual Immersion site.

While I understand and respect the difficult decisions involved in balancing enrollment and resources, this proposal leaves current ALC families—especially those within the Skyline network—in a very difficult position. It seems unreasonable to expect families to follow the ALC program well outside the Skyline feeder pattern for the remainder of their children’s schooling. Many of us chose this ALC program at Morningside because it aligned with our neighborhood schools and secondary pathways, and the relocation to Woodstock removes that essential continuity. Had we known this plan from the outset, many of us wouldn't have pursued it.

The impact on our youngest ALC students is especially concerning. Current first graders face a potential situation where they would follow the ALC to Woodstock, then possibly not test into the 3rd grade cohort, resulting in three different schools in three years. This kind of disruption is not only impractical for families, but also harmful to the stability and well-being of children who thrive on consistency.

I recognize that the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP) at Oakridge and the Middle Years Programme (MYP) at Churchill are being discussed as potential alternatives. These are strong, forward-looking programs that could serve students well in the future. However, building them to full implementation will take years, and in the meantime they do not address the immediate needs of the students who are already part of the ALC program. We need a clear bridge for this current group of students, rather than asking them to endure multiple transitions and uncertainty.

I urge the Board to consider a transitional solution: keeping the ALC program at Morningside until a fully functioning PYP is in place at Oakridge and a clear, continuous pathway into Skyline’s IB program is established. There is strong demand for ALC within this area, and Morningside has both the space and the student interest to sustain it.

The district made a commitment to families when it opened these programs. To relocate ALC now, without a comparable and operational alternative, undermines that commitment and disrupts the academic trajectory of students who have already invested in this pathway.

I respectfully ask that you revisit this portion of the recommendation and provide a solution that supports our current students while also building toward the district’s long-term vision.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Name removed]""


Additional Feedback: ""Yesterday I spoke with more than 15 ALC families, and the feedback was remarkably consistent: a move to Woodstock is not seen as desirable and, for many, simply will not be an option. Some families are even considering private schools, which runs counter to Granite’s mission of serving and retaining students. Our children risk being disbanded after years of building friendships and community.

 
One compromise that seems both fair and feasible would be to phase out the current ALC cohort at Morningside:

2026–2027: Morningside hosts 3 ALC classes (2nd, 4th, 5th)

2027–2028: Morningside hosts 1 ALC class (5th)

 
This approach would allow current ALC students to complete their track without disruption, while maintaining public confidence in Granite’s commitment to its programs.""

""To Whom it Concerns: 
My name is [name removed] and I am a parent of a current Morningside student.  To share some insight we moved from out of state to our current home 18 months ago PRECISELY so we can be in the Morningside>Churchill>Skyline network because of the educational reputation.  We obviously are upset and quite frankly confused by your recommendations to close Morningside Elementary.  These recommendations stand directly opposed to the stated goal of optimizing enrollment, enhancing educational resources and opportunities and better serving the students attending these schools.
1) You don’t close one of the most utilized schools to solve under-utilization elsewhere.

This year Morningside is at 565 students (87% utilization), higher than Eastwood (54%), Oakridge (47%), Upland Terrace (57%), Cottonwood (62%), and Rosecrest (59%). The district’s own table shows this clearly. Closing a high-demand school to backfill lower-demand schools is backward. 

2) The district’s “in-boundary vs attending” framing penalizes Morningside for being a school of choice.

Yes, only 189 in-boundary students attend Morningside, but total regular-ed attendance is 565. Families are choosing it, including our own. That indicates program quality and culture worth protecting, not eliminating. The Board should fix boundary/program mismatches, not shutter a school that families actively pick.  Research should be undertaken to understand why families are choosing Morningside and lessons learned should be implemented at lower enrollment schools. 

3) Facility conditions are not a problem at Morningside.

On the district’s Facility Condition Index list, Morningside sits at 20 (better than Oakwood at 60 and Penn at 58). Diverting students from a relatively sound building to poorer-condition facilities is fiscally inconsistent. 

4) The proposal undercuts neighborhood access while keeping the campus as a school anyway.

The plan shuts the neighborhood school but keeps the Morningside building as a stand-alone K-5 French DLI magnet (325–350 students), with an emphasis on recruiting from outside the district. That means local kids lose a walkable neighborhood school… located in a building that still functions as a school for others. That’s an equity and access problem. 

5) Reassignment to Driggs creates a split feeder and fractures community continuity.

Under the plan, some Morningside neighborhood students are reassigned to Driggs, which then becomes a split feeder, a configuration the district elsewhere tries to avoid because it fragments cohorts and weakens school-community ties. The proposal knowingly introduces the very pattern it lists as a planning concern. 

6) Capacity “after” the change leaves little buffer for rebound enrollment.

Post-change projections put several receiving schools at 78–90% utilization (Driggs 81%, Oakridge 90%, Penn 89%, Cottonwood 78%). That reduces flexibility for enrollment rebounds and program growth, especially risky on the east bench where generational turnover can quickly repopulate schools. Keeping Morningside open preserves needed capacity headroom. 

7) Transportation and safe-route burdens go up for current Morningside families.

The district lists “Safest Walking Routes” and “Transportation” as formal factors, yet offers no concrete analysis showing net safety improvements from shifting Morningside kids to Driggs or other schools. In practice, closing a walkable neighborhood option and sending children across busier arterials increases distance, busing needs, and family car trips. That cost and safety isn’t accounted for. 

8) The ALC consolidation further strips academic choice from the east side.

The plan consolidates east-side ALC into Woodstock and removes ALC from Morningside. Families lose both the local neighborhood school and a nearby gifted option in one stroke, precisely the opposite of the district’s stated aim to align programs with demand. 

9) The stated problem of excess seats can be solved without closing Morningside.

Your own presentation identifies where the slack is: Eastwood (54%), Oakridge (47%), Upland (57%), Cottonwood (62%). Right-sizing can come from boundary refinements and targeted program placement, not by zeroing-out a building that’s already running at 87% enrollment and that families vote for with their feet. 

10) Outcomes ignore the core community signal.

The district notes “over 1,000 individual pieces of feedback.” High utilization + strong open-enrollment draw are objective signals of community preference. The proposal discounts both while prioritizing a new magnet vision that serves non-resident recruitment over resident access. 

I look forward to discussing in more detail at the upcoming September meetings.

""Hello Granite School Board,

I’m writing to express my disappointment and concern regarding the recent decision to designate Morningside Public School as a French-only DLI (Designated Language Instruction) program.

While I understand the importance of offering French immersion options, maintaining an entire school for a niche program that is unlikely to ever operate at full capacity seems shortsighted — especially given the broader needs of our community. This decision effectively limits access to a public school building that could better serve a more diverse student population.

Many families would benefit from a dual-track model — incorporating both French and ALC streams — which would ensure more efficient use of the space while also better reflecting the needs and interests of the surrounding neighborhoods.


I strongly urge the board to reconsider this decision and explore more inclusive, balanced solutions for Morningside.

""My name is [name removed], and I am a parent of students at William Penn. I am writing in response to the recent announcement regarding the Pac Study and the recommended closure of Eastwood and Morningside Elementary.



From my understanding, the Pac Study was initiated because of declining enrollment on the east side, with the stated need to close one to three schools. However, the current recommendation raises several concerns that I hope the board will carefully consider.



1. Equity and program distribution

Closing a neighborhood school while keeping it open solely for a minority program displaces an entire community. Morningside currently houses two specialties in addition to its traditional track, which is already a heavy burden for one school. Yet, keeping an entire building open exclusively for French DLI seems unsustainable. Unlike Spanish DLI, which is consistently oversubscribed at William Penn, there is not the same level of interest or demand for French. It is hard to see how a whole school can remain open for such a small program.




To my knowledge, French DLI has not been an overly requested program, nor is it constantly turning away students. Where, then, do we expect additional students to come from to justify dedicating an entire building to this program? In contrast, Spanish DLI at William Penn is consistently sought after, and every year students are turned away because of space limits. Importantly, the majority of students in William Penn’s Spanish DLI are from within our community boundaries, with very few admitted on special permit. I do not believe an out-of-boundary population alone could sustain an entire school for either French or Spanish DLI.




2. Impact on ALC and feeder networks

Moving the ALC program out of boundary to Woodstock disrupts the Skyline and Olympus feeder networks. Many ALC students come from these neighborhoods, and shifting them to Woodstock means students will be pulled out of their natural friend groups and later funneled back toward Wasatch and Skyline. This constant shuffling between networks is disruptive and unnecessary.



3. Possible alternative

It seems far more reasonable to combine French DLI and ALC together at Morningside. This would allow the building to serve specialized programs drawing students from across Skyline, Olympus, and potentially other networks, without isolating them or forcing unnecessary feeder disruptions. Woodstock already has a specialty program that serves its own feeder schools; there is no need to duplicate or uproot thriving programs elsewhere.



4. Lessons learned from William Penn/Millcreek

As a William Penn parent, I’ve seen firsthand how program mergers can damage communities when not carefully planned. When Millcreek DLI was merged into William Penn, Millcreek families stopped returning, and the intended benefits were lost. We cannot afford another misstep that prioritizes convenience over what is best for students and their communities.



The Pack Study was intended to address declining populations and the financial need to close schools. The current recommendation, however, seems inconsistent with that purpose. Closing schools while simultaneously keeping entire buildings open for small specialty programs does not appear to be the best solution.



I urge you to reconsider these placements and ensure that the decisions made truly serve students and families—not just the convenience of program placement. Please take the necessary time to find a long-term solution that strengthens communities and preserves stability for our children.



Thank you for your time and consideration.

""Granite School District Board of Education-
Thank you for your continued work on the school board and for your astute questions during this week's meeting during the sharing of the PAC recommendations. I am writing as the parent of a 1st grader in the ALC at Morningside, and am deeply concerned about the PAC recommendation to relocate the ALC to Woodstock Elementary.

The travel distance to Woodstock is unreasonable. We live up Emigration Canyon and during morning traffic the projected time to get to Woodstock Elementary from our home is 40 minutes (assuming good weather). This is prohibitively far and as a two working parent household this is not something that we will be able to accommodate twice a day, nor do we feel it is reasonable to ask Emigration families to do so. 
""All children...have a right to have the opportunity to make at least one year of academic growth during a school year"" (graniteschools.org). Many ALC kids struggle in a traditional classroom setting - if the work is too easy or not aligned with needs of gifted and high ability students, then we are not meeting the needs of the students and they fall short of their potential. This can translate to boredom causing behavioral issues or, as in the case of my daughter, trouble connecting socially with her peers that don't see the world the same way she does. The ALC classroom this year has been instrumental in helping her ""find her people"". The reasoning for reducing the ALC program presented in the meeting was highly editorialized and used flawed logic. My understanding is that kids going through the ALC program are highly successful in their future education - please provide any data that the ALC is not meeting learning needs of students, or somehow failing students that might be in the top 6% vs 3%, to justify reducing access to this program. If the merits of the ALC program need to be evaluated, this should not be done through the boundary analysis of one area, but separately across the entire district for equity and appropriate resource allocation. 
3 different schools in 3 years. Like most ALC kids, my daughter went to her boundary school (Eastwood) for kindergarten. If the ALC moves these kids have to endure 3 different schools in 3 years, which is very upsetting.  And with the Eastwood closure we can't even return to her previous school for some consistency. How is this constant school change in the best interest of the children?
Concerns for planned attrition. The stated goal to reduce the number of ALC spots conflicts with the desire to increase special programming to draw families to the district. Students test again in 2nd grade to continue the program - if there are fewer spots planned to be available in subsequent years and a student isn't able to continue in the ALC we would be stuck with a 4th new school in 4 years. It is simply not worth the risk of further disruption to our daughter. Again, if a smaller ALC program is desired this needs to be evaluated at a whole district level so that locations can be chosen that actually make sense, rather than being decided as part of one area study.
Disrupted feeder patterns. Moving ALC students to Woodstock separates them from the feeder patterns to Churchill and Skyline.
Families with siblings have to deal with multiple schools. Most families do not have all kids in ALC or all kids in DLI. Splitting up families will lead to fewer students choosing French or ALC so that their kids can stay together. This will have the opposite of the intended impact on enrollment, particularly for the DLI program. Without a safety net of staying at the boundary school, if a student chooses to stop participating in DLI under this program they would be required to change schools.
No clear projections of increased DLI enrollment to justify removing boundary and ALC kids from Morningside. The stated goal to draw out-of-district kids to DLI is both flawed and is clearly biased against the needs of in-district children. Butler Elementary (Canyons district) has a French DLI program in Cottonwood Heights <5 miles from Morningside. Why does the PAC think it will attract these children to Morningside instead?

Given all of these factors, with the long drive and considering our youngest child entering K in 2027, if the ALC moves not only will we not follow it, but I have already started exploring our out-of-district options. Indian Hills has an advanced program only 12 minutes from our house, vs a 40 min drive to Woodstock. We will absolutely stay at Morningside if the ALC stays, but I suspect we are not alone in needing to leave the district to meet the needs of our daughter and our family if the program moves so far away or is eliminated. Please vote to keep the ALC at Morningside.

""Dear Granite School District,

Please do not close Eastwood. It is an excellent school. There is a good possibility we would leave GSD if Eastwood is closed. Here are some of the reasons why you should not close Eastwood, in my opinion:

We chose Eastwood. Last year, we tried the Morningside Advanced Learning Program (4th grade) and the Morningside French Immersion (1st grade). This year, we are back at Eastwood because we and our children much preferred Eastwood, where they had been for all prior years. The community, the teachers, the emphasis on STEM--we feel very fortunate to have found such a great school.

We live in Emigration Canyon, so we live within the Eastwood boundary and are bused to Eastwood. If our boundary school switches to Oakridge, it would be a significantly farther bus ride. Moreover, because of the longer ride through the canyon, middle schoolers--who already need to be picked up before 6:30am in our neighborhood--would need to be picked up even earlier. Numerous studies have shown that earlier start times are detrimental to children's health and learning. 

Many Eastwood families are from out of boundary. If Eastwood is closed, many of those families will simply leave GSD rather than go to Oakridge. The assumption that ANY Eastwood families would go to Oakridge is false. There are many schools with open spots, including Salt Lake City schools and private schools. Closing Eastwood will likely lead to a decline in GSD enrollment, which will lead to closing more schools, leading to a further decline in GSD enrollment, etc. 

Look what happened to Canyon Rim.

Other closed schools have turned into attractive nuisances during the time between their closure and re-purposing the land. I doubt this would happen to Eastwood as the land is so valuable, with proximity to freeway and mountains. But it begs the question--is this why it is being chosen for closure? 

I don't care if the class sizes fluctuate or we have to have split classes occasionally. That is better than the alternative--for us, for GSD, and for the future of public education.

""Hello,

I'm writing to the GSD school board in regards to the proposed changes to the Morningside ALC program location. It is my understanding that you are considering moving Morningside ALC to Woodstock Elementary. If this were to happen I would remove my child from the ALC program for the following reasons. 

I currently have a 5th grader in Morningside ALC who will be attending Wasatch Jr. next year, as many Morningside ALC families do. I also currently have a 2nd grader in Morningside ALC. It would be an impractical burden for families to transport children across the district.
It has been stated the ALC program should be serving the top 2% of academically gifted students. Would it not then make sense for these children to feed into the top High School in the district and state? Why send them across the district? Parents who want their children in the ALC program will want them going to Skyline High. The program should be located near there for practicality in multiple child families and consistency with friends.
Please reconsider moving Morningside ALC to Woodstock. A cross valley commute is not what my family signed up for when we entered this program. We would love to stay in ALC, however, this proposal is impractical and unfair to the majority of students who attend Morningside ALC and live north of Morningside.

""Good Afternoon,

I was glad to see Driggs remain open in the first boundary proposal. I have two children who currently attend Driggs, and based on our location, they will continue there. However, I am concerned about the two areas proposed to shift from Driggs to Cottonwood.

Why are Driggs students being so disproportionately affected? While it is difficult that Eastwood is closing, those students are at least moving together.  Traditional students and program groups at Morningside are also staying intact. At Driggs, however, it feels as though students are being split apart. This raises real concerns about the impact on established friendships and student emotional well-being.

I respectfully ask that you consider:

Whether priority permits could be offered to students who have previously attended Driggs.

Reducing the number of students reassigned from Driggs to Cottonwood.

Exploring alternative ways to support Cottonwoods enrollment, such as moving the French program there. This would keep program groups together and maintain continuity through the feeder schools.

Eastwood El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, Eastwood Closure","I strongly oppose the closure of Eastwood and fully support the idea of bringing Morningside’s ALC program with Eastwood.  The north section of Morningside’s boundary should also go to Eastwood, not to Rosecrest.  Eastwood’s demonstrated record of academic strength, the high number of GT certified teachers already in place at Eastwood, and the Gold STEM designation all makes this an excellent fit.  ALC families with multiple children that may not all test into ALC would have a single school where every child regardless of ALC has a strong academic program to attend.  Morningside Elementary should be closed altogether.  A French DLI standalone school is destined to fail.  French immersion is NOT a draw that most parents want.  I was highly interested in DLI programs for my children in Chinese or Spanish, but would never consider enrollment in a French Immersion program.  We were accepted into a Chinese DLI program in the Canyons school district, but ultimately CHOSE Eastwood (again due to the overall strength of its academic program).  Instead, Morningside’s DLI program could be moved to Oakridge and the traditional students divided between other neighboring schools including Eastwood as mentioned above to bolster enrollment.  
Eastwood is perfectly positioned in terms of location, accessibility, and reputation for academic excellence to become a magnet STEAM/ALC school.  The visibility from the freeway (especially if a new school were built on the property) would highly increase the likelihood of attracting out of boundary students.  Oakridge on the other hand is the poorest choice for future growth.  No one outside of residents of Olympus Cove even knows that Oakridge exists, but everyone who has ever driven down 1-215 knows where EASTWOOD is.  
Regarding pick up and drop off at Eastwood – I can personally attest to this as I have lived on Eastwood Ave for over 10 years and commute past Eastwood elementary every day.  Now that I have school-age children I drop my children off (at the south end of the property), then turn onto Wasatch Blvd as I head north onto I-215 and Salt Lake City.  I have NEVER encountered a single traffic delay on Wasatch Blvd during Eastwood’s school drop off nor pick up times.  The traffic light at the intersection of 3300S, I-215 and Wasatch Blvd and the one-way drop off circle in the Eastwood parking lot (in addition to the second drop off/pickup location on Eastwood Ave) allows for effective traffic flow and the claim that pick-up and drop off would be difficult (even with increased enrollment) is FALSE.  
Finally, more than half of Eastwood families have indicated that they will not attend Oakridge if Eastwood were to close.  This is not an “emotional” response to the PAC recommendations and parents are not lying about this.  Please stop gaslighting parents about this data.  This is based on real facts and considerations including commute times (we work in Salt Lake City), after-school options (again in Salt Lake City), and proximity to other excellent SLC public schools and charter schools (CRA).  Emigration Canyon students will not go to Oakridge if Eastwood closes (why would they??).  The projected enrollment at Oakridge in the PAC study slides for next year are therefore FAR overinflated.  Adding 100% of Eastwood’s enrollment is NOT realistic.  Oakridge is probably looking at gaining no more than 100-150 students (optimistically) if Eastwood closes, leaving it still well short of the 500 student “goal” of the PAC.  Therefore, this proposed merger would completely negate the stated goal of the PAC in the first place (i.e. it will still be a “too small school”), and Granite school district will have lost a substantial amount of Eastwood students to charters, private school, and the SLC district for NOTHING.

""I am writing as a parent of a current Woodstock ALC student and wanted to share some questions and concerns regarding the recent communication about the proposed merge of the Morningside ALC program into Woodstock.

While I understand that this recommendation is still under consideration, I would like to better understand what this could mean for students currently enrolled at Woodstock. Specifically:

1. How will class sizes and staffing be adjusted to support the increased number of ALC students?

2. What resources or facilities will be expanded to ensure that all ALC students continue to receive the individualized attention and enriched instruction they need?

3. How will the district support a smooth transition for both Morningside and Woodstock families if the recommendation is approved?

I appreciate the careful thought that goes into these decisions and the opportunity for families to provide input. My main hope is that the high quality of education and student experience at Woodstock is preserved while also supporting the incoming ALC students and their families

Eastwood El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, Eastwood Closure","Move the Advanced Learning Center (ALC, gifted program) from Morningside to Eastwood. Eastwood’s central-east location (just off I-80/Wasatch) is more accessible to families from across the east bench who might attend an accelerated program. Eastwood could host the ALC (which draws ~100 students) with minimal disruption: those students would benefit from Eastwood’s STEM labs and high-performing culture. This would immediately raise Eastwood’s enrollment and utilization, securing its viability. = 446+ students. 
Benefits: 
High utilization score
High performing schools
Keep GOLD STEM
Minimal loss of teachers from either school.
Maximizes the competitive advantages of GSD to effectively compete with charter and private schools and attract out-of-district students.
No unsafe routes.
No increased bussing and the hazards and costs associated therewith.  The bus that is currently bussing kids to Morningside could also be used to alleviate the lengthier bus route caused by only 1 bus (for all kids) in Emigration Canyon.  That bus could do the elementary route for both neighborhoods.
Traditional students have priority for up to 5 years to go to any area school, so that they can stay with other family members and friends.  This will improve utilization scores and teacher resources at the schools they choose to attend and avoid splitting up friends and families.
PART II: Traditional Student Boundaries
For the northern portion of the current Morningside Boundary (already bussing, N. 3300 S.), re-draw boundaries to add to EW (already bussing).
Benefits:
Adds students to EW (21-46) traditional classroom for improved teacher resources
There is no split feeder at Rosecrest.  Split feeders hurt the emotional well-being of the ~5 kids from each grade that will be forced to go to a different junior high than all of their friends.
 No additional bussing.
For the southern portion of the current Morningside Boundary, re-draw boundaries to add the northern part (North of 4500) to Upland Terrace and the southern part (South of 4500 S) to Cottonwood, Driggs, or Oakridge.
 Benefits:
Adds students to Upland Terrace to help for improved teacher resources.
 If Cottonwood, helps for improved teacher resources at that school and leaves the Driggs boundary alone.  This section is already a bussing area (because it crosses 4500 S) so it could either walk or continue bussing.
*If Driggs, allows for additional capacity at Cottonwood if the Board chooses Cottonwood as its location for DLI.  (See below).  This section is already a bussing area (because it crosses 4500 S) so it could either walk or continue bussing.
If Oakridge, helps for improved teacher resources at that school.  This section is already a bussing area (because it crosses 4500 S) so it could continue bussing.  There is also a walking path over the freeway that would allow students to walk if it were properly cleared of snow and maintained. 
Re-boundary Penn to move 84 students who are closer to Rosecrest to Rosecrest to alleviate crowding at Penn, improve Rosecrest utilization and teacher resource scores, and give some room for Penn’s DLI program to grow (it currently turns away students.   
PART III: Cottonwood, Oakridge, DLI
Merge DLI with Cottonwood or with Oakridge at whichever building best fits the district’s goals;  merge CW and OR and leave DLI at Morningside; or merge OR and Morningside Traditional class at MS and move DLI to Upland Terrace.       	
Considerations for DLI + Cottonwood at Cottonwood:
Helps increase Cottonwoods utilization rate.
Puts DLI near boundary in great area to capture the students leaving Butler Elementary’s French program when it closes and draw in students from out-of-district.
Potential capacity issues if try to stay at Cottonwood campus and not sufficient attrition.
DLI will not be a standalone program school, which typically causes programs to fail and which the district has said it wants to avoid.
 As a program, DLI is already supposed to be a commuter program so it minimizes the risk of unsafe walking routes or increased hazardous bus routes.
   Considerations for DLI + Oakridge at Oakridge:
This and the next option are most in line with PAC recommendation.
Helps increase utilization rate of whichever building is used.
As a program, DLI is already supposed to be a commuter program so it minimizes the risk of unsafe walking routes or increased hazardous bus routes if DLI moves to Oakridge.
Potential traffic issues due to weather conditions and steep streets near Oakridge.
Oakridge has high student and teacher attrition.  The Board should study the root cause of those numbers.
  Oakridge has lower FCI score than Morningside.
Potential capacity issues.
 Considerations for either CW or Oakridge to merge at either building and leave DLI at Morningside.
 This and the prior option are most in line with PAC recommendation.
Morningside has a better FCI score.
Would require additional bussing from CW or Oakridge.
 Does not make sense to displace MS Trad students and replace them with OR trad students.  Consider keeping some MS trad students at MS.   
 Considerations for merging Oakridge with Morningside Traditional class at MS.  DLI goes to CW.
 Oakridge has lowest FCI score
  Oakridge students can catch the bus from Churchill to Morningside.
There is a protected walk over I-215 where students can also walk safely to MS.
 Keeps MS traditional kids together. 
Improves utilization score and teacher resources.
Keeps good testing scores.
Better options for pickup and drop off.
MS has low attrition and teacher turnover scores. 
Helps increase Cottonwoods utilization rate.
Puts DLI near the boundary in a great area to capture the students leaving Butler Elementary’s French program when it closes.

As a program, DLI is already supposed to be a commuter program so it minimizes the risk of unsafe walking routes or increased hazardous bus routes.
Program Swaps & Consolidation with Morningside: Granite’s recommendation currently is to close Eastwood completely and reconfigure Morningside into a single-program French immersion school. But an alternative path would be to keep Eastwood open and use it to relieve Morningside’s multi-program strain.
In essence, this alternative would consolidate Morningside into two other schools (French to Oakridge, ALC to Eastwood) rather than consolidating Eastwood into Oakridge. The net result is still the closure of one building (Morningside), but it maintains Eastwood and Oakridge as neighborhood schools, each now with a special program to bolster them (Oakridge gets French, Eastwood gets ALC).
This plan addresses Granite’s goals: 
educes one principal and building overhead (Morningside’s, which was on the table anyway), 
improves facility usage (Oakridge’s large building gets the DLI population; 
Eastwood gets the gifted program population), and does so without forcing any community into unsafe situations. 
Oakridge students would remain at Oakridge (plus new French students coming in), 
Eastwood students remain at Eastwood (plus new gifted students). It’s essentially a win-win: no one has to walk along Wasatch Blvd or get up at 5:30am for a bus, and both surviving schools gain something – Oakridge gets an exciting language program; Eastwood retains its STEM excellence and gains more bright students. A community member succinctly suggested this in a petition comment, noting “if Morningside is going to be broken up anyway, why not take the French Immersion to Oakridge…and move the ALC program to Eastwood as it has better accessibility for those coming from out of boundary.” 
It’s a logical solution that was not genuinely explored by the PAC, yet it accomplishes consolidation without sacrificing safety or quality."

Hi, my name is [name removed]. I am a student at Morningside Elementary in the ALC program. I have been in the program since 3rd grade. Before I moved into the ALC program, I was at Cottonwood Elementary for 1st and 2nd grade. At Cottonwood I was very bored in class and would even start crying, begging not to go to school because of it. Once I moved to the program, not only was I challenged in school, but made friends who have similar interests. Together, we have competed in debate tournaments, made it to the state level of National History Day, and just for fun made a slideshow about World War II. I may have found friends like these in a traditional classroom, but I didn't have to look far in the ALC program. The best part is, because I am still in the wider neighborhood, I am not cut off entirely from friends that live by me who go to their home schools. I don't feel isolated and separate from them like I might if I was at a school far away. Though the current plan won't affect me, because I will be in Junior High, I would hate for a kid like me to lose the opportunity to feel comfortable in an ALC program because there isn't one nearby.

10/9/2025 9:47:16,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,4. Eastwood El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, A Boundary Change, Eastwood Closure, Morningside Closure","Alternative Configuration Proposal: Relocating Programs to Strengthen East Bench Schools

Part I: Advanced Learning Center (ALC) Relocation

One option worth serious consideration is relocating the Advanced Learning Center (ALC, gifted program) from Morningside Elementary to Eastwood Elementary.
Eastwood’s central-east location—just off I-80 and Wasatch Blvd—offers easier access for families across the east bench who might enroll in an accelerated program.

Eastwood could host the ALC (approximately 100 students) with minimal disruption. These students would directly benefit from Eastwood’s existing STEM infrastructure, high-performing environment, and GOLD STEM designation, while the addition would immediately strengthen Eastwood’s enrollment and utilization (raising it to approximately 446+ students).

Key Benefits:
	•	Boosts utilization to a strong, sustainable level.
	•	Preserves a top-performing, GOLD STEM school within Granite.
	•	Minimizes teacher loss and disruption for both Morningside and Eastwood.
	•	Enhances GSD’s competitive edge vs. charter and private schools by keeping high-caliber programming in-district.
	•	Avoids unsafe walking routes or new bussing hazards.
	•	The existing Morningside bus could serve both Eastwood and Emigration Canyon, improving efficiency and reducing route length.
	•	Traditional students retain priority for up to five years to attend their preferred area school, supporting family continuity and balanced resource distribution.

⸻
Part II: Boundary Adjustments for Traditional Students

Northern Morningside Boundary (north of 3300 S):
Students already being bused could be re-zoned to Eastwood.
Benefits:
	•	Adds 21–46 students to Eastwood’s traditional classrooms, improving resource alignment.
	•	Keeps feeder patterns consistent to Rosecrest, preventing split-feeder issues that negatively affect student well-being.
	•	Requires no additional bussing.

Southern Morningside Boundary (north/south of 4500 S):
	•	North of 4500 S → Re-zone to Upland Terrace.
	•	South of 4500 S → Re-zone to Cottonwood, Driggs, or Oakridge, depending on district goals.
Benefits:
	•	Adds students to schools needing higher utilization and balanced teacher resources.
	•	These areas already bus or can safely walk; no new transportation concerns.
	•	Provides flexibility for DLI program placement (see Part III).

Penn Boundary Adjustment:
Re-zone 84 students closer to Rosecrest to relieve Penn’s crowding, improve teacher resources, and allow Penn’s DLI program (currently turning away students) room to expand.

Part III: Dual Language Immersion (DLI) and School Consolidation Options

If the District’s intent is still to reduce one building, closing Morningside while strategically redistributing its programs could accomplish that—without endangering students or eroding program quality.

Option A: DLI → Cottonwood
	•	Increases Cottonwood’s utilization rate.
	•	Positions French DLI in a desirable boundary to attract students transitioning from Butler Elementary’s closing French program and other out-of-district families.
	•	Potential capacity constraints should be reviewed.
	•	Keeps DLI integrated within a larger school community, which aligns with GSD’s stated preference.

Option B: DLI → Oakridge
	•	Aligns with current PAC recommendation.
	•	Increases utilization at Oakridge.
	•	Maintains DLI’s commuter nature, minimizing walking/bussing safety issues.
	•	However, Oakridge’s steep streets, weather challenges, high attrition, and lower FCI scores should be reviewed before finalizing.

Option C: Merge Oakridge & Morningside (Traditionals at Morningside, DLI → Cottonwood)
	•	Keeps Morningside’s stronger FCI rating in use.
	•	Maintains low teacher turnover and strong academic outcomes.
	•	Provides a safer commute with an existing protected walkway over I-215.
	•	Improves utilization across schools while preserving community continuity.

Part IV: Holistic Program Swap Approach

Granite’s current plan would close Eastwood and turn Morningside into a single-program French DLI school.
An alternative, community-supported solution would reverse that:
	•	Keep Eastwood open and repurpose it to host the ALC gifted program.
	•	Move French DLI to Oakridge (which has the larger facility).
This preserves both Eastwood and Oakridge as neighborhood anchors while achieving consolidation by retiring Morningside, which was already under consideration for closure.

District-Level Advantages:
	•	Reduces administrative overhead (one principal/building).
	•	Optimizes facility utilization.
	•	Preserves safe routes, community trust, and academic excellence.
	•	Avoids bussing Emigration Canyon students long distances.

Outcome:
Oakridge gains a thriving language program; Eastwood retains its STEM identity and gains a complementary gifted population.
As one community member summarized in a petition:

“If Morningside is going to be broken up anyway, why not take the French Immersion to Oakridge and move the ALC program to Eastwood—it’s far more accessible for families coming from across the bench.”

This option fulfills the district’s consolidation objectives without sacrificing safety, data integrity, or educational quality—a true win-win for students, families, and the Granite community."

""Dear Granite School District Board Members:

In follow up to the recent recommendation from the PAC, we feel compelled to share our family’s journey in Granite School District to date as we are absolutely reeling from this recommendation based on what we have been assured previously. 

We moved to Holladay three years ago and for our first year kept our girls at a private Montessori through the early childhood program. We felt strongly about doing our best to believe in the public school system and support that system starting at first grade for both of our children. 

Last year, after significant consideration, we applied and were accepted into the Spanish DLI program at William Penn for our daughter who was going into first grade. We were very excited about DLI and the opportunity we felt she would receive through participation. Unfortunately, we were underwhelmed. Our hopes for higher excitement and therefore engagement in our daughter’s attitude about school were dashed. 

Later taking the CoGat test last year, our daughter was offered a spot on the wait list at Morningside for the ALC program. We attended the meeting hosted at Morningside by Tamera Wright last spring. Our main questions were as follows: 

1. Was the fact that she was on the waitlist an indication that she did not test at the level where it would actually be appropriate for her to participate? Her test results were looked up and we were assured that answer was no and that her testing reflected a score that was within the range. 

2. What is the history of ALC in GSD and is the district committed to continuing ALC? We were told that ALC has been a high priority in the district for over 20 years and remained very committed to the program. 

3. We were aware of the boundary study and that we were making a choice to take our daughter from a school not on the potential list of closures to a school on the list, but what would that mean for the ALC program? Although we were certainly not assured of the future of Morningside we were assured that if the ALC program was moved, it would be moved to a neighborhood school. We assumed a “neighborhood school” meant the school would remain in the more immediate vicinity of the same neighborhood. 

4. Our youngest is in kindergarten and we have no idea if she will test into ALC or not.  How would we assure our children go through the same school progression if our youngest didn’t test in?  Morningside currently offers two other programs that may be a great fit for our youngest if ALC is not an option for her, and as stated above, if Morningside were to close, the ALC program would be moved to another neighborhood school, which theoretically wouldn’t disrupt the opportunities to keep them together and close to home.  Logistically, it is very challenging to have kids at different schools.

We’re sure these are not unique considerations to our family, but to be clear, our main priorities for this are as follows: 

1. We hold utmost value for the sibling relationship and giving them shared experiences (while honoring their unique differences and potentially varied educational needs) so they can grow together as opposed to apart.  

2. We are very community driven and want to connect with families in our area that we can assume become the playdates, study buddies, teammates, friends, and long-term classmates of their future. Not to mention the teachers… they become long-term memory drivers of our children’s and our experience at this phase of life.  What happens to these drivers of this massively positive experience our daughter has had? 

Given those considerations, part of why we chose Morningside is because it “ticked all of our boxes.” Although we are only near the beginning of our first year of experience with ALC it has been night and day for us in terms of the stimulation, education and enthusiasm our daughter comes home with each day.  The hopes we had for the DLI program at William Penn were realized with our daughter’s acceptance into ALC. Her teacher is phenomenal, she connects on multiple levels with her peers, and we are connecting well with these families. Our daughter is thriving in the ALC environment. We’re gutted to think that we might be torn from that so soon and that our daughter may be going to her fourth school in four years if we are forced to move her again. 

We don’t feel alone in our disillusion with GSD and the mixed messages that have been received. In listening to the board meeting, we hear more of an emphasis on trying to bring new families in instead of retaining existing families who live here and want to build roots here. It feels like potential future “clients” are being considered at the expense of existing “clients”. If this recommendation is what is decided upon, we will need to consider no longer participating in not just the ALC program, but public school in GSD, and will explore private school and applying for UFA funds, charter school and alternate school districts. Has possible attrition from this proposed decision and the resulting negative word of mouth been considered?

We realize this is a complex problem, and likely a “no win” situation for all you, but at this phase, the proposed changes feel like they’re being proposed based on incomplete considerations (boundary studies, not considering special programs and how they may affect student utilization; value of ALC to a broader selection of children than “gifted” 2% of the population) and do not achieve the stated goals while actively negatively affecting neighborhood families in the process.  We appreciate the opportunity to have our concerns heard and hope that further recognition of the value of the ALC program can be considered when informing a decision to reduce acceptance numbers. If the Morningside ALC program must be relocated, we also hope there will be further consideration for a location geographically closer to the community in which it currently resides.

Hopeful regards,

""To Whom It May Concern,


I am writing to express my concerns regarding the newly proposed boundary line for Driggs and Cottonwood schools. [Identifying information removed]


Under the proposed boundary change, our distance to Cottonwood School would increase to 1.5 miles. This distance appears disproportionate, especially considering Driggs School is only 0.5 miles away in the opposite direction. While I understand that boundary lines will always place some residents ""on the line,"" it is concerning that we are now being reassigned to a school three times the distance away.


My two younger children previously attended Kindergarten at Cottonwood. We frequently commuted by bicycle due to the challenging parking and drop-off situation at the school, and because we prioritize our children remaining active. I can attest that cycling along Wander Lane was a significant safety concern. Vehicles on this road often exceed the speed limit by 20 mph or more. Additionally, numerous home renovations and ""lawn restructuring"" projects on this road frequently force pedestrians and cyclists into the middle of the road and around work trucks, exacerbated by inconsistent sidewalks. The lack of safe infrastructure makes this route highly unsafe, and I am apprehensive about my three children having to navigate it again should this boundary change be implemented.


Currently, we walk to Driggs School, which is 0.5 miles away. This route is considerably safer, though I believe the short stretch of Wander Lane could benefit from sidewalk improvements given the number of children who walk there.


I respectfully suggest that the boundary be adjusted to Kentucky Avenue.


Should the proposed boundary remain unchanged, I intend to apply for my children to remain enrolled at Driggs School, as I am unwilling to subject them to the hazardous bicycle commute again.

""To whom it may concern. 

This is a statement in strong support of keeping Morningside Elementary, in particular the ALC program at Morningside, open.  

My daughter recently graduated from the Morningside ALC program. I cannot fully state my gratitude for this program. My daughter has ADHD and has been tested as very bright. If the Morningside ALC program didn't exist, we would NOT have had another public option that offered a suitable learning environment for her. We are public school people

We live at the top of Emigration Canyon and my husband and I both work in Salt Lake City. We have to drive through the Salt Lake school district to reach Granite school district, then back again to work. The drive to Morningside was commitment enough, and we were happy to find a way to make it happen for the quality of this program. If the school were any further from us we could not have been able to drive all the way there and still maintain our jobs in Salt Lake City. There are no bussing options for us that didn’t put my 1st grader on a bus with highschoolers at 6:30 am, then sitting outside of the middle school for an hour and a half, in all weather, waiting for a shuttle. Obviously not something we considered. If she hadn’t qualified for the ALC program, or if the program were any further away, she would have been another Canyon resident to attend school in Salt Lake, closer to home and our offices. You would have lost another student due to your inability to consider ALL of the students you pledge to educate. Also, our daughter would not have been able to be in the learning environment she needed, as Salt Lake’s Accelerated Learning Program program does not consider admitting students from out-of-boundary until third grade. To close Morningside is to completely disregard the educational and logistical needs of of the students at the northern side of the Granite School district. Closing the Morningside ALC program means that students like my daughter can not be served by public education. If your mission statement is to educate children, closing Morningside is the antithesis to your duties. Please keep the programs that bring such growth, support, joy, and learning, open.

""Thank you to the Board, PAC, and district curriculum folks for meeting with the ALC parents last night. Perhaps it was the expected outcome, but it seems that most parents left feeling more frustrated last night, not less, and that their concerns and requests for data are not being adequately heard or addressed. My key concerns and unanswered questions are as follows.

1) The only reason we have been given for why the ALC on the east side needs to be halved over the next 1-2 years is this arbitrary ""5%"" number and to be proportional with West side schools.
Top 5% on CogAT is not a national standard, a Utah State Board of Education recommendation, nor a GSD policy (at least not one that has been provided to parents). This threshold does not define giftedness.
National Association for Gifted Children - section 2.1 indicting multiple assessments should be used with no cutoff standard provided
NAGC position paper Defining Giftedness
Utah State Board of Education Handbook - section 2: "" Rule R277-707-3.B Enhancement for Accelerated Students states: LEAs shall have a process for identifying students whose academic achievement is accelerated based upon multiple assessment instruments.""
GSD Continuum of services - there is significant concern that cutting ALC (tier 5) will leave no practical support for children removed from the ALC in this manner - there is no tier 4 support in elementary, and tier 3 support is plagued by significant variation between schools and a lack of classroom support for clusters. It is unclear how GSD will meet their commitment that all children have a right to have the opportunity to make at least one year of academic growth during a school year.
We understand that the nature of forming classes means that a CogAT threshold score may not be feasible - but it is unfair to use this neighborhood 5% score as a hard cut off or to use it as a tool to cut the program. If 60 kids are top percentile scorers using composite scores, universal scale scores or standard age scores on the CogAT but there are only 30 spots, then GSD will call 30 of those kids ""gifted"" and 30 not. It sounds like the district has not evaluated actual scores for the ALCs and understanding this data is key to understand whether there are ""too many"" kids benefiting from this program. It would be similarly silly to say that a high schooler with a 34 on the ACT or a 1500 on the SAT would not thrive at an Ivy League school just because others in their neighborhood scored higher. 
This East side - West side comparison that has repeatedly come up unhelpfully pits the two sides against each other in an unfair way. Without real programmatic data you cannot argue that the East side needs to be cut. Why not expand the ALC into more schools on the west side instead? You do not improve equity between a short person and a tall person by cutting the legs off at the knees of the tall person - you give the short person the necessary resources to have the same view.
2) No evidence of harm having up to 10% or even 20% of kids in these ALC classes - perhaps ALC should be expanded and marketed to out of district kids. If a 5% threshold is not evidence-based in either the literature or from GSD data demonstrating poor outcomes it would be silly to cut a popular and successful program based on an arbitrary number.
NAGC position paper on grouping - see Special Grouping section discussing not just the academic benefits of grouping gifted and high achieving kids but also social-emotional outcomes
The Board asked PAC for more information on this issue during the Sept 2nd Board meeting and the PAC assured us that they would ""bring the data"" to the ALC families. As you know, they did not last night. The only additional data that they provided was a pie chart of one 3rd grade class, and no evidence that having the top 9% of kids in a class is somehow bad. Please share data on outcomes of children over the multiple decades of the program - are the top 2% of kids (on one standardized test) somehow being harmed by having to associate with kids who are the top 10% instead? Are the top 10% not reaching their potential? What might be the harm to these children if access to this program is taken away?
3) If a study on ALC is needed, let's study it. Please take the time to understand the data and identify appropriate locations for programming before making a decision. This may need longer than the 2025 boundary study allows.  As part of a study, let's explore what options there might be to market and grow the program by including more students from other districts. It was clear from the PAC and curriculum department's inability to answer any questions related to data that a more thorough study is needed. The current strategy of cutting the ALC feels more like a response to not knowing where to put it, rather than a true evaluation of the merits, benefits, and impact of the program.
After a proper study of the ALC program, if it's clear that we have ""too many"" gifted and high achieving kids and that students are being harmed by this, and GSD has committed to a 5% rule - reducing the ALC to one largely inaccessible location on the east side will still not solve your 5% problem.
Has an analysis been done on why some qualifying kids do not choose to go to the ALC? From parents that I have talked to that have opted out, it's usually that they prefer their neighborhood school (walkability, schedules, or friends) and cannot justify the inconvenience of moving to another school. 
Moving the ALC to only Woodstock makes the ALC inaccessible (hello from Emigration). An inaccessible program is not going to make it more likely that the top 5% will choose to go - the same ""problem"" will be exacerbated as top students will be unable to attend due to distance, schedules, and split families. This location creates a barrier to equal education for ALC students.
To reiterate for those in the back - the main reason we have been provided for cutting ALC in half on the east side is this 5% threshold, but locating the program in a very inconvenient and logistically impossible location for many families will not make it more likely the new top 5% will attend.
4) I am concerned about the many misconceptions of ALC and gifted & talented programming that I have heard from the PAC and even occasionally from board members. Respectfully, it appears to me that many involved do not fully understand the program, its outcomes, impact, or frankly why gifted programming is something GSD has committed to. Some of the language used has directly or indirectly alluded to the following:
All children are gifted/talented, so special programming should not apply to just some 
Gifted and talented programs are ""elitist""
Gifted and talented children do not need special programming
Gifted students are just high achievers because they come from good social backgrounds/engaged parents
Early years IB programming is a good alternative option for gifted students
I truly hope that if any of the above are an opinion that you hold that you will take the necessary time to learn more about gifted and talented children and programming. The Utah State Board of Education Gifted & Talented handbook is a great place to start as all of the above are addressed in the ""typical misconceptions about gifted and talented learners"" on pages 17-19, but you will need to explore more for elaboration. Your current ALC teachers at Morningside, Woodstock, or across the district would also be an excellent place to learn more, as well as the NAGC. This program, which is a ""need"", is being proposed to be sacrificed for elective program ""wants"". 

5) Some of the French DLI reasoning is based on more hope than logic. Someone last night leaked that they expect the Butler French DLI just to the south of Morningside to close - Butler denies this, enrollment is full, and it is not part of the Canyons school district 2025 study. There has been no real projections of who these students are that are going to fill this school or where they come from. PAC has repeatedly tried to use the Spanish ALC as a comparator, which frankly does not make sense given the number of native Spanish speakers in Utah and the social benefits of Spanish. Why not leave Morningside as a magnet DLI/ALC school while a more thorough ALC study is completed to determine optimal assessment strategy and location? This will allow the French program time to assess growth and provide enough time for proper and equitable ALC assessment.

I know this was long, but I truly hope you have made it this far and will consider it. I want to end on a somewhat emotional plea. My daughter is in the first grade ALC with a wonderful teacher, [name removed]. All through Kindergarten at Eastwood she had no real friends - no playdate invitations and no one she closely connected with. In the second week of being in the ALC I heard for the very first time ""Mama I made a friend today"". The benefits of ALC go so far beyond testing. But now that she is thriving in this program our choice is a 3rd school in 3 years with an extra 40 minutes of commuting a day (""it's just an extra 10 minutes away!"" PAC says - but that is x4 trips a day), making our total commute time to-from our Emigration home 2x/day to be over 2.5 hours every day just for elementary school (never mind our other child and our jobs). And even if we committed to that, she might test out at the end of next year since there will be fewer slots, sending her to a 4th new school in 4 years (for what family could continue such a hellish commute for a traditional program), for someone whose giftedness means she also struggles to make friends.

Please reconsider the proposal to limit this program and limit access to it. The children need it.

Thank you,
[name removed]""

Additional feedback: ""1) If the same number of ALC spots (2 classrooms/no planned reduction) were maintained at Woodstock we would still not be able to follow it there.  We cannot feasibly make that commute from Emigration multiple times a day and balance our jobs and our other child's school. I'm not trying to be threatening when I say that our most likely alternative is Indian Hills, with its advanced program much closer to our home.  I don't want to do that, as we'd like to avoid switching districts twice (we would plan to switch back at Jr High). 

2) If the ALC moved to another Area 5 school that was central or north we would 100% follow it there. Rosecrest, Eastwood (pending closure), Upland Terrace, Driggs, or Oakridge would all be welcome options if it cannot remain at Morningside. If it moved to the southern edge of the district (Oakwood or Cottonwood) we would have to do some further evaluation as a family as that would start to become more of a logistical strain, which I acknowledge is specific to our personal situation of where we live, where our employment is, and our aftercare. 

We are fully invested in the ALC as we have seen extraordinary shifts in our daughter's engagement in school and improvements in behavior in just the first few weeks. We want to see the program thrive not just for her but for many others. I believe there is untapped potential to market the program and draw out of district enrollments, particularly from charter schools.

I look forward to further discussions at the public meetings next week. 
Thank you!

""I attended last week’s ALC/PAC meeting, and walked away with one overall question that no one could seem to answer - who is being hurt by letting in the top 10% of students, or even the top 20%, instead of the arbitrary ""top 5%"" you claim to be the ultimate goal of the ALC program? Steve Hogan claimed that the teachers have expressed they are unable to effectively teach because the quality of students in the program is not high enough. However, every single one of the ALC teachers from both Morningside and Woodstock confirmed they were never asked for input on the PAC's study. I was told by a current teacher that a former colleague often made this complaint, but she chalked those opinions up to this teacher’s competitiveness, rather than a true and real problem. Furthermore, the teacher who complained is now retired. On the student end, I have heard from zero ALC parents (and I'm in a group chat with 129 of them from Morningside and in contact with a separate group from Woodstock) that they feel their student was being dragged down by slower kids in their classes. In fact, what is wrong with a little diversity of talent among an already high performing group? I asked my 5th grade daughter this morning if she's ever seen a problem with less advanced kids in her classes. Her exact response was, ""No, we're all good at different things"". Now you may say this program was designed for the truly ""gifted"" student, but why not also serve the advanced learner? Why toss them out with nothing? (And don't tell me you offer ""cluster"" groups - my daughter was supposedly in one for 1st and 2nd grade and it was laughably non-existent. And don't even get me started on the less than uniform way your ""5%"" would be calculated year to year, or area to area, OR the fact that you can't even confirm if the west side ALC schools are capturing the top 5% even though they are drawing from more schools - you don't know, because as Steve told us, you've never studied it).
I ask you instead to consider the other side of this question - who is being served by allowing this program to include less than your ideal percentage? Hundreds of students each year are benefitting by being in a classroom with students who perform at a high level. These students enjoy school, thrive educationally, aren't put in a corner with an ipad to keep them busy while their classmates catch up, and most importantly, they find a place where they belong. Maybe this doesn't resonate with you - maybe your kids always fit in or found kids they could connect with, but you ask most ALC parents, and they will tell you that their child didn't find a place until they found the ALC program. This is especially evident for those of us with children who started later - like my daughter who joined in 3rd grade. She was generally happy in 1st and 2nd grade, though she was painfully bored in class. However, she never managed to make any close friends. She got along with people, but never fully clicked with anyone. I figured she was maybe just a more solitary kid. However, when we started at Morningside in 3rd grade, she became a completely different child. She came out of her shell in a way I'm not sure she ever would have in our neighborhood school. She made friends quickly, and she finally found people that she can be her genuine self around. The kids do quirky things together that my husband and I quietly laugh about, but we are overwhelmingly grateful that they found each other. A common phrase you hear among ALC parents is some version of the sentiment, “My child would have been stuffed in a locker if not for the ALC program”. Why not give these kids a chance to grow and thrive in an environment where their quirks and interests are celebrated rather than ridiculed? And why, in a struggling district, would you want to cut down a program that is popular, that parents turn down other opportunities to be a part of, and that has a waiting list? Are you purposely trying to sabotage GSD? It makes no sense. I urge you to allow a thriving program to continue!

""Dear Granite School District Board Members

First, I want to thank you for the hard work and long hours you’ve put into the boundary study. I know these decisions are incredibly complex and that you are balancing many priorities. That being said, I feel that even with the recent adjustments, Cottonwood Elementary is still getting the short end of the stick. The changes help a little, but they don’t truly solve our problem—and if nothing more is done, I worry we’ll be right back here in just a few years, once again facing the threat of Cottonwood closing. I have two children currently at Cottonwood and two more that will be there soon, so I feel fully invested in this.

Even with the proposed 100 additional students, Cottonwood will only average about 2.5 teachers per grade. That number is not sustainable. It leaves us with large classes or split-grade classrooms—something that makes it harder for teachers to give kids the focused attention they need and ultimately hurts student learning. And realistically, we won’t even get all 100 of those projected students, so the problem may be even worse in practice.

The most logical long-term solution, in my mind, would be to add the gifted (ALC) program to Cottonwood. It makes sense to place it at a school that already has such strong academic performance. My children have been in the gifted cluster, and I would love for them and others to have the opportunity to participate in a full ALC program right here. It would strengthen enrollment, attract families, and naturally bring in siblings of gifted students, helping Cottonwood reach sustainable numbers. The gifted program is such a great opportunity, it makes so much more sense to let it grow and thrive at Cottonwood rather than consolidate it at Woodstock.

Additionally, more boundary changes should be considered. Expanding Cottonwood’s boundaries to include everything south of 4500, as well as the new Cottonwood Mall area, would help bolster enrollment and give our school the stability it needs. Without this, Cottonwood families are being asked to settle for “just enough” students to survive—but not enough to thrive.

I also want to raise a concern about the French program currently housed at Morningside. I greatly value language learning, but it seems difficult to sustain a full program at a school with such low enrollment numbers. Since Driggs Elementary has a much larger capacity (around 700 students), it may make more sense to house the French program there. This would allow the program to grow in a stable environment while ensuring that Cottonwood receives the students it needs. Otherwise, the current plan risks keeping a school open for fewer than 200 children while Cottonwood struggles with enrollment and class size. Moving the French program to Driggs would also help ensure that students follow new boundaries, since Driggs is already at capacity, instead of permitting back out.

Having more teachers per grade doesn’t just help with class sizes. It lightens the load for staff and parents across the board—PTA, recess duty, drop-off and pick-up, and all of the small but important things that make a school run smoothly. Cottonwood families are dedicated and deeply invested in our school. Just because we don’t have a brand-new building or signs in every yard doesn’t mean we aren’t as passionate as any other school community. We love Cottonwood, and our kids are thriving here.

Please don’t let Cottonwood be left behind. With stronger boundary adjustments and by considering programs like ALC placement, Cottonwood can continue to be the heart of this community for years to come.

Thank you again for your time, your service, and for listening to the voices of families like mine who care so deeply about our children’s education.

It looks like this proposal still does not give Cottonwood enough students to build our enrollment to 3 classrooms per grade.

We need the new cottonwood mall boundaries and possibly more of Driggs or Morningside's old boundaries to be included in the new boundaries at Cottonwood. Another idea would be to put the ACL program at Cottonwood.

""Dear Steve,

Thank you for all the information you have considered in this PAC study and for your interest in helping our students. I wanted to share a few thoughts from my perspective. I am a parent of three Morningside ALC students, and I would love to share our family’s experience.

By way of background, I hold a master’s degree in education, have taught in the classroom, and have supervised students for BYU. I have a strong understanding of classroom differentiation and the unique needs of diverse learners.

My oldest child, now a 6th grader in the GT classes at Wasatch, began public school at William Penn. After a very difficult year, he was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety and struggled greatly in the traditional classroom. He tested into Morningside in first grade, and moving him there was a pivotal, life-changing decision. In the ALC environment, he could finally “swim in a fast-moving current” with peers who learned at his pace. A child once at risk of failing most of his classes—and struggling with focus and behavior—began to succeed, gain confidence, and realize his potential. I will always be grateful to his cohort for modeling how to learn. Today, he thrives in all of his gifted classes and has also built friendships in the ALC community with peers who embrace his “nerdiness.”

My second child, now in 4th grade, has also thrived in the program. While she hasn’t faced the same behavior challenges, she has flourished under the excellent instruction.

My third child has a very similar diagnosis to my oldest. Knowing his potential for classroom behavior struggles, I enrolled him at Crestview, where his aunt happened to be his teacher. She addressed his challenges, arranged ALC testing, and told me he had the highest kindergarten CogAT scores at Crestview. She strongly encouraged me to pursue ALC placement. Since starting at Morningside, he is completing his work (a new milestone for us!), reading chapter books, and showing growing enthusiasm for learning. It is working.

From a parent’s perspective, this program not only works—it is essential for kids like mine to reach their full potential. We put immense resources into supporting students with learning disabilities, and I find it shocking that we would cut a program that is equally necessary on the other end of the spectrum.

Our family even moved this past summer to be closer to Wasatch Junior High and the Morningside bus stop because we believe so strongly in this investment.

Selfishly, I would love for the Morningside ALC program to move to Upland Terrace, which is just a block from our home. But I have been shocked to hear that some Upland parents have resisted the idea. One of my closest friends [identifying information removed] has even argued with me that ALC “hurts” students—an argument I find perplexing from a school that prides itself on caring for “special needs.”

It is discouraging that the importance of this program isn’t more broadly understood. From the board’s actions and rhetoric, it feels as though the ALC community is being overlooked or mischaracterized. If my children were thriving in traditional classrooms, wouldn’t I gladly choose that simpler path?

I sincerely hope we do not reduce this program or move it to an overcrowded school further from the population center it serves. The benefits of ALC also extend beyond the program itself. Many ALC families enroll siblings in traditional tracks, contributing to school numbers, clubs, programs, and parent involvement. ALC strengthens schools—it doesn’t detract from them.

I urge the board to reconsider its recommendations. I hope my family’s experience can provide some meaningful anecdotal data to help in this decision.

Sincerely,

""Dear PAC Committee,

Thank you for the thoughtful work you are doing on the boundary and program study. I know these decisions are difficult and will have lasting impacts on schools and families across our district.

While the ALC program at Morningside may not be especially large in terms of enrollment, the cultural impact of hosting a specialty program within a small neighborhood school can be significant. When only part of a school participates in a program, it can create a divide between students who are in it and those who are not. This impacts school culture and community relationships in ways that numbers and data do not always show.

As a Rosecrest parent, I want to be clear that I do not want the ALC program placed at Rosecrest. Our school is already small, and I believe introducing a separate program would create unnecessary division instead of strengthening our community.

I believe each school should have one clear identity. If a school has a specialty program, that program should involve the entire school community rather than dividing it between multiple tracks. For this reason, I thought the idea of combining the ALC program at Woodstock made sense. Centralizing the program is more sustainable, and if families truly value ALC, they will be willing to travel to access it.

Thank you for considering this perspective as you move forward in your decision-making process.

I have a child in 1st grade at Cottonwood Elementary. She loves school deeply and has zero complaints. I also have a 3-year-old at home, we look forward to sending him to Cottonwood. 

For the last two years at least I know our school has worried about maintaining two teachers per grade based on the 27.56 student head count required per teacher for salary funding. 

We need this worry for our school to go away. 
We need to get creative with teacher funding as population sizes are shifting. We should have a guarantee funding of a two teachers per grade regardless of head count. 

There is currently a classroom with 38 students in one of the older grades. This is not acceptable. That class should have two teachers. I fear my daughter would not do well in over crowded class like that and I might be forced to remove my kids from Granite if that happens. 

Please expand Cottonwood's boundaries so we don't have to worry each year about weird classroom sizes. Please work on revising funding laws for teachers that don't rely on student head count. I would be happy to help with this endeavor.

""Dear [Granite School District Board / Boundary Study Committee],

I am a parent of [names removed] children at Cottonwood Elementary in grades first and third. I want to thank you for your hard work on the boundary study, but I’m very concerned that the current plan doesn’t really solve Cottonwood’s problem. Even with 100 more students, the school will only have about 2.5 teachers per grade, which means larger classes or split grades. That’s not good for teachers or kids.

Cottonwood is a high-performing school where my children thrive. We choose to special permit there because of the schools amazing reputation. To keep it strong, I ask you to:

    •    Give Cottonwood more students through boundary changes (for example, south of 4500 and the Cottonwood Mall area).

    •    Consider adding the ALC program here, since Cottonwood is already such a strong academic fit.

    •    Reevaluate housing the French program at Morningside and instead place it at Driggs, which has the space and would help balance enrollment. 

      Right now with the current changes it leaves Driggs overpopulated and oakwood overpopulated with the possibility of 3.5 teachers per grade and Cottonwood with just 2.5 teachers per grade. By doing one of the above recommendations we can hopefully get each school more equal so no school has to have split grades or large classes. We would love to get cottonwood to the spot where we can have 3 teachers per grade. Please take these things into consideration so we can continue to keep the amazing reputation cottonwood elementary has and provide our kids with the best education. 

Please don’t let Cottonwood be left behind. With the right boundaries and programs, it can remain a thriving school and the heart of our community for years to come.

I’ve spent many years with students coming through elementary observing how Morningside worked to integrate the three programs. I’m impressed and grateful for their efforts. However, with the option to isolate one of these programs (DLI or ALC) into their own school, it makes much more sense (in my opinion) for the DLI program to have a separate school and group the ALC and traditional students in the same school. As we currently attend Morningside it sounds great to stay as things will be familiar for us there and I think it is known around the community that Morningside has a French program and already attracts some our of bounds and even out of district kids for that program. However, I think the DLI program could do well at any school and should the committee and the board decide that the program needs to move to another of the schools in the study we could be in support. Having DLI in its own school will allow a culture shift for the whole school so the DLI students can be more fully immersed not just in the language but in the culture of the language at school. In an effort to keep this comment more brief, I’ll not list them all-but I’m happy to be contacted and provide several specific examples of situations where the DLI kids have different needs (like singing songs at the holiday performance in French) from the needs of the students in ALC and traditional classrooms. Again, as a parent of students in ALC I realize too that they have different needs. For this I’m grateful they have a separate classroom and we’ve loved our experience interacting with those teachers and that program.

""To the Boundary Study Committee:

Thank you for your work on this challenging issue.

We are the parents of three former Cottonwood Elementary students who now attend Olympus Junior High and Olympus High School. I also have two current Cottonwood students, a second grader and a kindergartener.

I agree with your initial proposal that Cottonwood Elementary stay open. Most crucially, Cottonwood Elementary is consistently the top testing of all Granite SD elementary schools. It is working! It is excelling! 

We firmly believe that adding more students to an already high functioning school is far superior to shuttering a top performer and hoping for the best elsewhere. Secondly, much of our current boundaries are geographically remote from any other elementary school and bussing young students distantly would be detrimental to them, their families, and their learning readiness.

In addition, we encourage you to reconsider the proposed rezoning for other affected students and instead consider the following:

-- Send the Advanced Learning Center to Cottonwood Elementary. Because of Cottonwood's stellar academic credentials, it is a natural location fit for this program. Many Cottonwood students, including my own, have tested into the ALC but chosen to remain at Cottonwood where they are already exceptionally well served by outstanding administration, teachers, and like-minded community of parents and students who value academic excellence. They also benefit socially and emotionally from belonging to community of neighbors -- the essence of public school! 

-- Close the French Dual Language Immersion program or rezone it to a neighboring school like Driggs, rather than keeping Morningside Elementary open. Dual Language Immersion programs for native English speakers have largely fallen out of favor nationally and even Utah research suggest limited benefit, as marginal improved test scoring is negated when accounting for high-performing students' overrepresentation in one-way language programs. (See https://www.schools.utah.gov/curr/dualimmersion/resources/Student%20Performance%20Under%20Dual%20Language%20Immersion%20Scale%20up%20in%20Utah.pdf). 

A French DLI program is not attracting primarily native speakers seeking English learning support. It is attracting academically-motivated English speaking families. Group these families and students with other similarly focused students where they can flourish in a stronger neighborhood community. By aggregating these students to already high-performing neighborhood elementary schools, we create stronger local schools rather than multiple, too-small, cash-strapped specialty schools. A rising tide lifts all boats!

-- Expand the boundary area for zoning to Cottonwood Elementary. Cottonwood should include all students east of Highland Drive and below 4500 South. Anecdotally, we believe that the majority of them who have not opted out to private schools may already be attending Cottonwood. The relevant question to ask is not just how to rezone but how to attract and retain these top-performing students away from private schools. 

We have read the extensive information supplied by Granite District about ""ideal"" arrangements for schools. Another lens to consider would be currently proven results -- namely, Cottonwood performs! To our understanding, it is the only Great Schools ""10"" rated elementary in all of Granite District. Cottonwood results speak for themselves. Families buy homes in its boundaries to attend this school. It is your top performer. Let's reward this! By expanding the availability of its success to more students and families, we keep the school strong for years to come. 

We appreciate your thoughtful, dedicated work.

Go Condors!

Gratefully,

""Dear Valued School Board Member,

I write to you today not to advocate for the preservation of any one school, but to respectfully and earnestly ask that you consider making and supporting a formal motion at your upcoming Board Meeting on October 7, 2025: Motion to pause and extend the Area 5 Boundary Study timeline by at least one additional school year.

After reviewing the recording of your February meeting, it was clear that several of you expressed thoughtful hesitation before voting to initiate the study. I ask you to revisit those initial concerns and reflect on how the process has unfolded since. Whether the timing felt premature following recent closures, the complexity of Area 5’s diverse programs and needs was underestimated, or key data should have been gathered beforehand, these reasons for caution remain deeply relevant. Initiating and supporting a pause is not a setback. It is a responsible and courageous recognition that more time is needed to make a truly informed and equitable decision.

If you attended the recent public meetings, thank you for listening. If not, I sincerely hope you will take time to view the recordings. Across both evenings, families raised thoughtful and heartfelt objective concerns. Many pointed out that the current recommendations fall short of resolving the very issues the study set out to address, particularly the goals of eliminating split grade-level classrooms and balancing class sizes. Without further refinement of the PAC’s current recommendations, many students in Area 5 will continue to face these suboptimal learning conditions.

With a modest extension, and more dialogue with parents and teachers that reaches beyond the current subcommittee, I believe Mr. Hogan and the PAC will be better positioned to develop a recommendation that genuinely reflects the needs of our students and families. One that will serve Granite School District not just today, but for generations to come. Examples of specific areas that merit deeper study include:

Consolidation solutions that eliminate split classrooms and balance enrolment across all Area 5 schools
The future direction of the ALC program
The demand and long-term viability of a French DLI-only Magnet School
Safe walking routes and timely transportation 
Thank you for your continued dedication to Granite School District’s mission: “Working together with families and the community to empower students to achieve their highest potential.” Your leadership matters deeply, and your willingness to listen and adapt gives our community hope.

I kindly ask that you respond to this message and let me know if you are able to commit to making and supporting a motion to pause and extend the Area 5 Boundary Study timeline at the October 7th Board Meeting.

Warmly,

1. Relocate the Advanced Learning Center (ALC) to Eastwood Elementary.
Eastwood’s location offers better access for families across the east bench. This change has many benefits, such as:
	•	Raises Eastwood enrollment to ≈446 students, improving utilization.
	•	Preserves a top-ranked, GOLD STEM-designated school within Granite.
	•	Minimizes teacher loss and disruption to both Morningside and Eastwood.
	•	Keeps programs in safe, accessible locations
	•	Allows current buses (e.g., Morningside and Emigration Canyon) to operate more efficiently.
	•	Strengthens Granite's ability to compete with charter/private schools.
	
2. Adjust Traditional Student Boundaries.
	•	Northern Morningside (north of 3300 S): Re-zone to Eastwood—adds 21–46 students, improves resource use, keeps feeders intact, no extra bussing.
	•	Southern Morningside (around 4500 S): Re-zone north of 4500 to Upland Terrace; south of 4500 to Cottonwood, Driggs, or Oakridge depending on district goals.
	•	Penn Boundary: Shift 84 students closer to Rosecrest to relieve crowding at Penn and allow DLI program expansion.

OR boundary change to move Oakridge students to Morningside and Eastwood.

3. Optimize DLI Placement and Consolidation.
Place DLI in more strategic location:
	•	French DLI → Oakridge or Cottonwood (depending on capacity).
	•	ALC → Eastwood, leveraging its STEM programs and accessibility.
Additional Benefits:
	•	Reduces one principal/building overhead.
	•	Improves utilization at both Oakridge and Eastwood.
	•	Maintains continuity for students and families.
	•	Avoids unnecessary risk and long commute times.

Summary:
This alternative achieves consolidation without compromising safety or performance.
It’s a practical, data-driven solution that fulfills Granite’s efficiency goals while protecting families, teachers, and students.

""Earlier today, I sent an email about my concern that the current PAC proposal leaves Cottonwood Elementary under enrolled. Since sending the email, we had a Community Council meeting at our school where we brainstormed an additional solution that could help our school and others that are intentionally left as small schools. This is a potential solution that we discussed: 

Create a “Small School Grant” to help schools with low-zoned populations. The district has the opportunity with this boundary study to close 2-3 schools and equitably distribute the population to ensure that the remaining schools have 3+ classrooms per grade. However, if the board would prefer to have several small schools instead of consolidating them during this study, I think they should allocate money so there are not 30+ kids in a class or split-grade classrooms. The majority of states–36–currently have a policy that limits the number of students in a single general education classroom. (In Kentucky, classes are capped at 24 for K-3; in Florida, it’s 18.) Granite should be a leader in bringing this to Utah. I think that elementary schools that have less than 450 students in general education classes, projected class sizes above 30, and no boundary study within the next two years, should be able to apply for a “small school grant” to provide an additional teacher(s) at the school.

I have updated my original email below to reflect that addition. You can also access my letter here.

September 24, 2025

Dear Population Analysis Committee and Granite School Board Members, 


As a Cottonwood Elementary parent, I am grateful for the Population Analysis Committee’s proposal to keep Cottonwood Elementary school open. Cottonwood is the highest-performing elementary school in the district, it has the highest retention rate of students within its boundaries of schools currently being studied, and it draws students from surrounding schools both within and out of the district. I agree with the PAC’s recommendation to keep us open and serve the southern end of our district.

That said, I am concerned with the PAC’s current proposal to add just 100 students to our boundaries. We have been dealing with a small zoned population at our school for the last few years, leading to large class sizes in the upper grades and putting a burden on our hard-working teachers. My fifth grade daughter is in a class of 38 students and was in a similar-sized class last year. I’ve seen the exodus of neighborhood families to private schools during the last two years because the class sizes are too big and are not a healthy learning environment for many students. We’ve been patiently waiting for this boundary study to go ahead so that we can have a healthy population that supports three full grades at our school.


Unfortunately, the current proposal falls short. Our current population supports just two teachers per grade. Under the PAC’s proposal, if we receive all 100 new students that would be zoned for us from Driggs, it would only get us to 2.5 teachers/grade,* which means more large class sizes or split-grade classes. This is exactly the situation that this study was supposed to remedy. Our teachers and families are very much against split-grade classrooms, opting instead to have very large classes to avoid a split. And this is if we get all 100 students, knowing full well that many Driggs parents will opt to special permit back into their school. This is not a meaningful amount of students to keep an elementary school strong and sustainable, which is the stated goal of the study. If the board approves the PAC’s proposal as-is, it is leaving Cottonwood Elementary to die on the vine.

Potential solutions:

Zone all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive to Cottonwood Elementary. The PAC’s current plan gives Driggs enough students for approximately 3.5 classes per grade and Cottonwood 2.5 classes/grade. We need a more equitable split. Rezoning all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive would potentially yield Cottonwood 220 new students, giving each school approximately 3 classes/grade.


Send the DLI program to Driggs. The current plan calls for closing Morningside and opening it as a French-only school. I support the idea of having immersion programs housed separately from traditional schools. However, we do not currently have enough students in our area to support 8 elementary schools. Closing Eastwood solves the problem of having two small schools in Olympus Cove. But merely redistributing the traditional classes at Morningside (150 students) to Rosecrest and Driggs, does not solve the small school problem at Cottonwood Elementary (or Rosecrest for that matter). Driggs is a high capacity school–it can fit up to 700 students. It can fit 2-3 traditional classrooms per grade and the French immersion program. Cottonwood Elementary would yield more rezoned students if the DLI program was placed at Driggs because there would be less room for rezoned families to special permit back in. This plan is also a more efficient use of resources because the district would only need to fund administration and facility costs at two schools instead of three.

Relocate the ALC (gifted) program to Cottonwood Elementary. We would love this program! The idea to request this program at our school was raised at our September PTA meeting and was met with overwhelming support. As the top-scoring elementary school in our district, the ALC is a good culture fit at our school. I think we could attract many ALC siblings and students on the ALC waitlist because our traditional program is so strong; it’s an attractive school for high-performing families. Additionally, having the ALC program at our school would raise the already-high test scores here. We are currently the #3 ranked elementary school in Utah by US News and World Report. With higher test scores we could potentially get to #1, which we could market to bring in students from bordering Canyons District and beyond. 

Create a “Small School Grant” to help schools with low-zoned populations. The district has the opportunity with this boundary study to close 2-3 schools and equitably distribute the population to ensure that the remaining schools have 3+ classrooms per grade. However, if the board would prefer to have several small schools instead of consolidating them during this study, I think they should allocate money so there are not 30+ kids in a class or split-grade classrooms.

I think that elementary schools that have less than 450 students in general education classes, projected class sizes above 30, and no boundary study within the next two years, should be able to apply for a “small school grant” to provide an additional teacher(s) at the school.

I’ve sent six kids to Cottonwood Elementary and it has served them all extremely well. By the time the PAC proposal is voted on and adopted by the school board, I’ll have just two years left with my youngest child. If the current proposal goes through, it’s enough of a bandaid that she’ll be fine for those remaining two years. But as the chair of the community council and a member of the PAC subcommittee, I’m deeply concerned about the long-term welfare of the school for my community. I believe that the PAC’s current plan will send our school into a death spiral. If we continue to have large classes or introduce split classes, we will see an exodus of families for schools outside of the district. This is an affluent and highly mobile area and parents have the means to leave for private or charter schools that better serve their students. It has already started to happen within the last two years; it is inevitable with the PAC’s current plan. 

Please amend the current plan to provide an equitable distribution of students and resources among the schools in our area. We are a happy, engaged, high-performing school! We’d love nothing more than to welcome more families to our community.


Sincerely,

*A note on numbers:


Cottonwood Elementary’s current population is 320 students. The district currently funds one teacher per 24 K-2 students and one teacher per 27.25 3-5 students. This is a table that shows the current numbers of students/grade at Cottonwood Elementary:


K-43, 1-52, 2-46, 3-47, 4-56, 5-76

With our current numbers, we are able to fund two teachers per grade. 


The PAC presented a chart that predicts next year’s population at 330. This is wildly optimistic given that we will be losing our highest-enrolled grade (76) and replacing it with a number that is likely closest to our kindergarten class, our lowest-enrolled grade (43). A more accurate estimate would be an incoming kindergarten class of 43 students, which is what we had this year. This table shows what our enrollment numbers are likely to be next year without any boundary changes:


K-43, 1-43, 2-52, 3-46, 4-47, 5-56

In that case, our population in 2026 would be 287, nearly two class sizes below what the PAC is projecting. Even if we received all 100 students that the PAC is currently proposing to rezone to us, that would only give us enough students to fund 15 teachers – 2.5 teachers per grade. In 2027, it would be even lower because we’d again be losing our highest-enrolled grade and replacing it with a lower-enrolled one. We would lose another 0.5 teacher.""

""Dear Population Analysis Committee and Granite School Board Members, 

I currently have three children that attend Cottonwood Elementary. We love and adore Cottonwood Elementary and everyone that works and attends there! As a Cottonwood Elementary parent, I am grateful for the Population Analysis Committee’s proposal to keep Cottonwood Elementary school open. We are the highest-performing elementary school in the district which draws students from surrounding schools both within and out of the district. We are also the most southern elementary school in our district which also attracts a lot of students from outside our district. I was very happy with the PAC’s recommendation to keep us open.

Although I was happy about staying open, I am concerned with the PAC’s current proposal to add just 100 students to our boundaries. While we are grateful to have been given the 100 additional students we all know that realistically we will probably get less than half of that 100, because they all want to remain at their current school of Driggs which can house them. We have been dealing with a small zoned population at our school for the last few years, leading to large class sizes in the upper grades and putting a burden on our hard-working teachers. I currently have two fifth graders who are in their second year of having 38 students in their classes. It has been hard. It has been hard on them and it has been even harder on our teachers. We have had many neighbors opt to send their children to private and charter schools because they don't want their child in a classroom with that many children. We have chosen to stick it out and deal with it because we love supporting public education, but I don't blame these parents for making this decision. I have served on the community council the past 3 years and we have been patiently waiting for this boundary study so that we can have a healthy population that supports three full grades at our school.

Unfortunately, the current proposal falls short and does not give Cottonwood what this study promised to fix. Our current population supports just two teachers per grade. Under the PAC’s proposal, if we receive all 100 new students that would be zoned for us from Driggs, it would only get us to 2.5 teachers/grade, which means more large class sizes or split-grade classes.

Like I stated earlier, we really love Cottonwood. It has been a wonderful school for our children. They have loved their teachers and administrators, they have  learned and grown so much while attending Cottonwood and we have loved being a part of this special community. Once these changes take place my youngest will only have two years left in elementary school and I am worried she will spend her last two years in elementary school in split level classes because we didn't solve the problem at Cottonwood. I’m deeply concerned about the long-term welfare of the school for my community. I believe that the PAC’s current plan will send our school into a death spiral.

""Hi Steve,

My name is [name removed], I am a parent of students at Upland Terrace and Wasatch. Hopefully this email finds you well, I am sorry you are getting the brunt of all this chaos with the PAC study, it is so much. I attended the meeting at Olympus high and was very impressed with how you held your composure when there were a lot of unkind and unthoughtful comments.

I am emailing you in hopes of communicating a few of my thoughts, as I am not sure if I will be able to come to all of the community council meeting at upland tomorrow and don’t want to miss the chance to voice these.

We love our Upland community and feel that we, as parents, have strived to make this an inclusive school. One of our major strengths is our special needs program at upland, my son was in the first co taught kinder class last year and it was such a positive experience for him. I have loved seeing the kids with special needs thrive and continue their bonds with my son. Adding another special program to our school could potentially diminish was has been created. I would ask the question if morningside is staying open for a special program (French immersion), why is one of the programs staying and not the other? The school will still be functioning and it will be empty, it would make more sense to leave it at morningside if there is not now plans to move it to Woodstock.

From a parent, outside of morningside’s community, it seems like attendance (from those in the boundary) in the traditional program is lacking, as is seen in class sizes this year. The special programs, while great if you are part of them, seems to be divisive and I feel that is not something we are about at upland. We would love kids from morningside or eastwood’s traditional programs…we welcome new students!

My proposal would be to reconsider the traditional student boundaries you are sending to Rosecrest (and those going to Driggs who will end up at skyline) keep them in the skyline network by sending the traditional students to Upland, Wasatch, and Skyline. Most kids in the canyon rim area attend Wasatch anyways so that group should definitely be coming our way. We would love more traditional students from Eastwood as well. More students, we are all for, more programs, we can pass on!

Thank you for taking the time to look over this!

Morningside El,Skyline,A Boundary Change,"My concern regarding the possible decision to keep Oakridge open over other school options is safety.  Oakridge is high, east on the hillside, which makes it much more difficult to access the school--on foot, and especially by car--than other school locations.  Winter driving will be particularly precarious.  I, personally, have struggled to get up that hill in my car, even with 4 wheel drive engaged, and I worry for others who do not have that feature in their vehicle.  
Additionally, there is only one road in/out to reach Oakridge, and this road is shared by the Churchill Jr. High population, as well.  If anything were ever to happen which would require any sort of an evacuation or school dismissal, the road would be completely clogged and dangerous to navigate.  And if anything happened to block that one artery in and out, not only would the school attendees be unable to get in or out of the area, but congestion for the neighborhood residents would also be impeded.
Please reconsider your decision regarding Oakridge as a safe school.  It's location does not encourage student walking, nor does it make it a safe route for parents to drive in and out of throughout the school year."

-Dear Population Analysis Committee and Granite School Board Members,

As parents at Cottonwood Elementary, we sincerely appreciate the Population Analysis Committee’s recommendation to keep our school open. It’s been widely shared already that Cottonwood has consistently ranked the highest-performing elementary schools in the district. And Cottonwood has strong parental involvement and engagement which has made it a popular school to draw students from outside the district. So we believe that keeping Cottonwood Elementary open is very beneficial to the Granite School District and to the families in this part of the district boundaries.

We first chose to go to Cottonwood Elementary 12 years ago when our oldest daughter, who suffers from ADHD and has auditory processing challenges, was going into kindergarten. And our local school was a Chinese immersion school and we were very concerned that, not being a part of the immersion program, she would not get the required to achieve her basic scholastic needs. We considered going to a private school, but we had family who attended Cottonwood and gave the school a strong recommendation. Our experience couldn’t have been better. The IEP teachers took so much care to ensure that she was always progressing. Our next two girls didn’t have IEP and tested into GT classes and they also had very rich experiences and our youngest daughter is currently in the third grade and loves school.

So we believe that our point of view can offer a more personalized perspective, being a family who permitted in from out of the boundaries and parents of a child with an IEP and parents of children with high test scores. And Cottonwood Elementary has been a school that has given our children such a rich learning environment.

With that said, we do not feel that the current proposal meets the longer-term needs for this school. We have been dealing with a small zoned population at our school for the last few years, leading to large class sizes in the upper grades and putting a burden on our hard-working teachers. By adding only 100 students to our boundaries, the low enrollment will perpetuate. Even if all 100 students were to enroll, that would only get our school to a 2.5 teacher-per-grade ratio – which would still lead to large class sizes or split-grade classes. And it’s much more likely that, after permited does little to correct this trajectory. At best, if Cottonwood were to gain all 100 students from Driggs (which is unlikely given the option to special permit back in), the school would still average only 2.5 teachers per grade. This will require either split-grade classes or oversized classrooms – both of which will hurt performance. We are already seeing some families in our boundary opting to go to private schools rather than having their child in a class with more than 35 students in their class.

The proposed boundary adjustment only adds a potential 100 students to Cottonwood’s boundaries. Even if all 100 students were to enroll, that would only get our school to a 2.5 teacher-per-grade ratio – which would still lead to large class sizes or split-grade classes. And it’s much more likely that, after permited does little to correct this trajectory. At best, if Cottonwood were to gain all 100 students from Driggs (which is unlikely given the option to special permit back in), the school would still average only

2.5 teachers per grade. This perpetuates the cycle of split-grade classes or oversized classrooms—neither of which strengthens our school community or ensures long-term stability.

We strongly recommend modifying the proposal to give a more lasting solution to attract new families, retain existing families, and provide a high-performing school for the district and our community.

We propose all of the following:

1. Zone all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive to Cottonwood Elementary. The PAC’s current plan gives Driggs enough students for approximately 3.5 classes per grade and Cottonwood 2.5 classes/grade. We need a more equitable split. Rezoning all students below 4500 South and East of Highland Drive would potentially yield Cottonwood 220 new students, giving each school approximately 3 classes/grade.


2. Remove the French DLI Program. The current plan calls for closing Morningside and opening it as a French-only school. However, we do not currently have enough students in our area to support 8 elementary schools. These DLI programs where English Learners and English-native speakers can learn together provides equitable access to learning. But the demographics for this program at Morningside seems to primarily serve advantaged students and not a strong mix of English learners. We do not believe that the district should bear the costs of the specialty program. Many of these students will then go to one of the other elementary schools in the district and help to strengthen the schools.


3. Relocate the ALC (gifted) program to Cottonwood Elementary. We would love this program! The idea to request this program at our school was raised at our September PTA meeting and was met with overwhelming support. As the top-scoring elementary school in our district, the ALC is a good culture fit at our school. I think we could attract many ALC siblings and students on the ALC waitlist because our traditional program is so strong; it’s an attractive school for high-performing families. Additionally, having the ALC program at our school would raise the already-high test scores here. We are currently the #3 ranked elementary school in Utah by US News and World Report. With higher test scores we could potentially get to #1, which we could market to bring in students from bordering Canyons District and beyond.


4. Create a “Small School Grant” to help schools with low-zoned populations. The district has the opportunity with this boundary study to close 2-3 schools and equitably distribute the population to ensure that the remaining schools have 3+ classrooms per grade. However, if the board would prefer to have several small schools instead of consolidating them during this study, I think they should allocate money so there are not 30+ kids in a class or split-grade classrooms. The majority of states–36–currently have a policy that limits the number of students in a single general education classroom. (In Kentucky, classes are capped at 24 for K-3; in Florida, it’s 18.) Granite should be a leader in bringing this to Utah. I think that elementary schools that have less than 450 students in general education classes, projected class sizes above 30, and no boundary study within the next two years, should be able to apply for a “small school grant” to provide an additional teacher(s) at the school.

""Dear Julie Jackson, 

I am writing you to let you know I am NOT in support of bringing the gifted program (or language programs) to Upland Terrace elementary. I currently have three children at that school and one at Wasatch. My reasoning for this opinion is based on other families experiences and my fear of jeopardizing the loving community that Upland Terrace currently has. We know many families at Morningside elementary who do not feel a sense of belonging because of the programs at that school. The students who want traditional learning feel like outcasts and bottom tier. This is not just a feeling from Morningside neighbors, but from many schools with dividing programs. I love that Upland Terrace still has that feeling of a neighborhood school. My kids are all able to safely walk to school which I love. More programs = more traffic to our school, which I do not like. I know SEVERAL families trying to purchase homes within the Upland boundaries because of the community here that still supports their Neighbourhood school. 



Please do not change what Upland has. If people want different things for their child, they will make those sacrifices and go wherever those programs exist. Put the programs where they are needed. Please keep Upland a neighborhood school with neighborhood support.

10/9/2025 12:00:56,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,4. Eastwood El,Skyline,Other,"After the last few meetings and media comments, I wanted to outline some discrepancies observed. 
Busing Concerns:
District officials have repeatedly asserted, in public meetings and to the media: that bus times for Emigration Canyon students will be reduced under proposed plans of a Emigration Canyon only route. This assertion is demonstrably false. Even excluding the Millcreek/Cove student pickups (which introduces separate logistical concerns), the proposed canyon route to Oakridge time would not be reduced as outlined below. 

A simulated Emigration bus route (in a car) was performed on current Emigration stops: 2133 N Pinecrest Canyon Rd, 680 N. Emigration Canyon Rd, 6676 E Emigration Canyon Rd, Last Monument Cir & Pioneer Rd (625 N), 672 N Pioneer Fork Rd, 5220 E Pioneer Fork Rd, 5025 E Emigration Canyon Rd (Firestation), 4815 E Emigration Canyon Rd, 4371 E Emigration Canyon Rd, 4072 E Emigration Canyon Rd. (can provide bus stops list given to us by Cirbie at the beginning of this school year) 

This car simulation was conducted at 12pm on an average weather day on October 8, 2025. In the simulation, the car stopped at each Emigration stop for 30 seconds to simulate allowing kids to get on and get back into traffic. Total time in simulation was 51 minutes with just Emigration stops then to Oakridge via Wasatch Blvd up to Oakview. The current route takes 53 minutes, as provided in the times given by our bus driver at the beginning of the school year. This simulation showed that having a route of just Emigration students will not reduce the daily commute and will be basically the same as the current route at Eastwood, including its Millcreek stops. This does not take into account how much time would be added for morning traffic, winter road conditions, or other variables.  It also does not take into account that the district’s plan to have the bus stop only at Emigration Canyon stops is not feasible as set forth below:

The proposal to have a designated bus for Emigration Canyon students only does not work. Granite would need two buses at $220k each, just for the Millcreek/Cove pickups as bus capacity plays a bigger role than they would like to admit. There are 136 students in the Eastwood boundary that would be bussed. That number is not inclusive of the Emigration Canyon students. The bus capacity for elementary students is 84. To safely bus all of the Millcreek/Cove students, plus the 33 Emigration kids, would require three buses or for the Emigration Canyon bus to make stops in the Cove area, thereby increasing the overall bussing time. This number also does NOT include the high school and junior high students that are on the bus after school on Monday through Thursday with the elementary school students. 

The Skyline/Churchill route services approximately 18-20 high school and junior high students Monday through Thursday afternoons. The recommended plan does not take into consideration that because there is only one bus for all of Emigration Canyon kids, a longer bus ride for elementary school kids would require the bus to start earlier for Jr High and High School students. It currently begins picking up junior high kids at 6:10 a.m. and has just enough time to drop them off and drive back up the Canyon to pick up elementary school children. If any time is added to the elementary bus route, the junior high and high school kids would have to be picked up before 6 a.m. and be at school an hour before it opens. They still would not arrive home until after 4 p.m., meaning that they would spend 10+ hours away from their family for a 6.5 hour school day.  

Regarding the need for 3 buses, Dr. David Gatti, Transportation Director, told those in attendance at the Nov. 12, 2024 board meeting, when speaking on PAC recommendations and buses: that any suggestions must be bus-neutral because the district building could not park any additional buses. “[J]ust as an FYI we have no more - this is a true statement - No More parking spaces at transportation for buses if we continue to add needs for buses we would probably have to have some sort of a capital project to be able to park them there because we are - we have no empty spaces so we're maxed at that point.” see 11/12 board meeting at 01:29:00-01:30:30.

Moreover, for the last three years, the Emigration families have been told there are no additional bus drivers. "

""Hello Mr Hogan,

I am a Morningside mom of two (1st and 3rd grade) both in DLI. I was at the meeting at Eastwood with my kids mostly to see what was going on and to have them experience a little bit about civics and what is happening with their school. I came into the meeting much like other parents: upset at the recommendation and skeptical of the district and the PAC’s position. But I would like you to know that I found your responses and patience compelling. I do not envy your position and I believe that you and the superintendent were very genuine in trying to address the concerns of an angry and sometimes belligerent crowd. I hope that Morningside will show more courtesy and understanding despite the emotional nature of this situation in your future meetings there. From my involvement with Morningside parents on this matter, I believe they will. 

I have many questions about the proposal and I will reserve those for the right forum but I felt like you probably don’t get much positive feedback from parents right now. [Identifying information removed], I know what it is to have the job that everyone loves to hate. For my part, I believe you and your colleagues are trying to make the best of a hard reality. Thank you for your patience in the face of upset parents (I know well that there is no more formidable force). I look forward to your future presentations and reaching a solution that is best for our kids. 

If I can be of any assistance in communicating to the Morningside community in advance of the coming meeting, please let me know.

""Dear Ms. Jackson,

Hello. I'm writing regarding the proposed closure of Eastwood and ALC/traditional programs at Morningside.

[identifying information removed]

I understand that enrollment is declining, but closing a high-performing, successful community elementary school and restructuring another very successful school seems like it will make the problem WORSE, not better. Sure, some families will threaten to leave the district and either not actually leave or leave and then come back after they cool off (Steve's prediction). However, a non-zero number of families will leave the district forever to private, charter, and SLC schools. That is less money for the district, and less money for schools. The hemorrhage from the district will get worse, leading to more school closures, more students leaving the district, etc.

Why do we have to close a school? This is not a rhetorical question. The communities of Eastwood and Morningside obviously want to keep them open and continue their current structures. Closing schools DOES NOT eliminate the problems of split classes and wide variation in class size; it could even make them worse. And even if we have to have split classes, we would rather have split classes, large class sizes, etc., than lose Eastwood. 

We would rather keep Eastwood and have fewer resources provided by the district and state--our PTA is excellent at raising money. Give us more opportunities to funnel money into programs from parents. Have more parent volunteers in larger classrooms. Support us to transition Eastwood into a STEAM Magnet School. Let parents market Eastwood to other parents in their communities--let's bring back students from charter, Salt Lake, private, and homeschooling. Give us other ideas! 

Let's think outside the box and make Granite School District STRONGER not weaker.

Thanks in advance for your response and consideration.

Sincerely,

""Good morning,

I appreciate you taking the time to read this and listen to my concerns.  I live in the boundaries for Upland Terrace Elementary and have learned with the PAC Study, it has been proposed that the ALC Program (currently at Morningside) be reassigned to Upland Terrace.  I feel strongly that this should NOT happen.

Upland Terrace already has two programs with a healthy dynamic at our school (Traditional Education and the Special Education Programs).  These two programs work closely together and have created a safe and positive environment for all our students, and community.  Adding a third program (ALC) would greatly disrupt the students, staff, family and community of Upland.  I have seen the interactions & relationships our traditional students have formed with our SPED students and it is truly beautiful. 

Bringing a third program would increase traffic at our school. The danger for students to walk would increase, leading to a double-edged sword situation, as more boundary students would be driven (hoping to decrease their own student's risks), increasing the risk for students who still walk.  I walk with my students everyday, and don't want more traffic to become a danger (our crossing guards do an amazing job, but with more traffic, more danger is inevitable).

We want to encourage boundary enrollment, not turn it away because we are bringing out of boundary students into our school.  I personally witnessed this at Canyon Rim Elementary (when it was a public school within Granite District).  Out of boundary students were brought in, class sizes grew too large, boundary families felt excluded from their own school and felt pushed to enroll their children at other schools.  This led to a drop in enrollment and, as you know, the eventual closure of Canyon Rim as a public school (and then the reopening as a charter which has created its own issues for Granite District and nearby elementary enrollment).  This also seems to be a similar scenario as Morningside, once again resulting in a traditional, boundary school closure.  I don't want to see this happen to yet another public elementary school within our district and community.

I have talked with parents in the ALC Program who want to keep their traditional (non-ALC) siblings at the same (non-boundary) school their ALC student attends.  While I think this is admirable for families to want to keep siblings at the same school, it's important to acknowledge these families chose to take their ALC students away from their boundary schools to attend a special program located elsewhere.  Having non-boundary, non-ALC students attend an out of boundary traditional school program is a luxury, not a right.  If non-boundary, non-ALC students are allowed to come to the school the ALC Program moves to, this will cause multiple negative issues for that school.  ALC students and non-ALC siblings will enroll, the Traditional Program classes will become overcrowded and the school will have more kids than it safely allows.  Upland doesn't even have room to absorb just the ALC Program students, let alone siblings who would enroll.  This would lead to unhealthy and unsafe conditions for all students at Upland, regardless of program.   

I believe, and hope, we have the same goal: support our boundary schools, students, staff and families and have as little disruption as possible.  

A possible solution for all parties involved with the least amount of disruption would be to continue offering the ALC Program at Morningside.  There are enough classrooms to house the ALC Program and the French Program, eliminating the dangers of an overcrowded school.  If the district's goal is to grow the French Program (and/or the ALC Program), these two programs can be observed over the next few years and modifications can be made in the next PAC study.  If these two programs outgrow Morningside, one of them can move to Eastwood as it is closing next year and the building should remain available for district/education use.  I understand that Morningside is closing as a traditional boundary school and non-ALC siblings would have to return to their traditional boundary schools, but I see this as a beneficial side effect as it would encourage boundary enrollment, increase community relations and balance many schools, rather than overwhelming just one school with enrollment of  ALC students and traditional siblings.

My hope is that you will take the well being of our traditional boundary school students and families (who may not be as vocal as we maybe should be) with just as much weight as those who are trying to, for lack of a better word, push their out-of-boundary students into our schools.  Please, please, take into consideration how the quiet majority is being minimized by the louder minority.  We don't want to be the squeaky wheel, but we need you to understand we are here too and are trying to advocate for our traditional, boundary students.  

Again, I genuinely appreciate you taking time to listen and take my voice into account as you make this decision. Please reach out if you have any questions, I would love to have a respectful and honest conversation about this.

""Dear Members of the Press & GSD Board

The following letter was sent to the Legislators today:

Granite School District (GSD) is recommending closure of two of its highest-performing schools, including — Morningside Elementary — claiming the closures are needed to “save money & improve resources.” Parents are concerned that these recommendations are based on flawed analysis and misplaced priorities that put administrators before kids.

According to the 2024 payroll data, GSD Superintendent Horsley, and Treasurer Hauber, were paid $369,879 & $465,453, respectively — more than the NYC DOE Chancellor, who oversees over 1-million students. This is in sharp contrast to GSD's 55,000 students. It is unacceptable that while Utah ranks near the bottom in per-pupil public education spending, the top GSD administrators' salaries place them in 95th to 99th percentile nationally. 

It appears scarce taxpayer dollars are being used for top administrator salaries while GSD targets top-tier schools like Morningside for closure. Morningside has an almost 90% utilization rate, and is ranked anywhere from 3rd to 5th among 51-elementary schools in GSD. It holds a 9/10 rating on GreatSchools. Despite its central location, rising enrollment, 3-way easy pickups & drop offs, strong community support, its central role as the academic anchor of GSD’s Millcreek/Holladay cluster, and the strongest future-ready STEM program — it is slated for closure.

The recommendation for closure doesn't account for the overwhelming number of high-density housing projects currently under construction, nor for the explosive 16% population growth that state and county projections forecast over the next decade.

Alarmingly, the head of the recommendation committee, Mr. Steve Hogan, also serves on Granite’s Real Estate Committee, which is responsible for selling surplus district properties. This dual role raises questions about whether financial interests in property sales will be prioritized over the need to invest in Utah's future - its tender students.

We request a legislative audit of executive pay, administrative overhead, GSD’s flawed population analysis methodology, and its real estate role.

Finally, we request the legislature to pass a study next session to examine a district split that would carve out a new Millcreek-Holladay district from GSD to better represent families, pare down administrative overspending, and improve per student resources. We argue that thriving neighborhood schools should be nurtured and prized, and that taxpayers deserve transparency and accountability in how education dollars are spent.

Sincerely

Morningside Traditional, Gifted, & DLI Families"""

""PAC and Granite Board Members,

Thank you for your recommendation to keep Cottonwood Elementary open and using the factors you outlined to come to this conclusion. Our location is unique and shows a need on the southern boarder as we have the highest retention of boundary students that choose to stay at this school. I know school ratings wasn’t a factor outlined but this also has helped retain our students and pull from neighboring districts (Me!). We have an amazing lot that has more potential than other schools that will serve more students well.

Unfortunately with the current proposal to only add 100 students to Cottonwood and the continued encouragement that students can permit back to the school they choose, isn’t looking promising for Cottonwood if the PACs proposal is left as is.

Some suggestions I would recommend:

1. Driggs needs a program, if not there is more room to allow permits back further hurting Cottonwood.
- Centrally located
- Highly Rated, better chances of program kids to attend
- Could unite all HS networks well

1.1. ALC at Driggs, all reasons above and it also would comfort Morningside’s ALC to be with Morningside’s Traditional.
- Strong Traditional presence to make sure ALC thrives
- Limits space and help newly boundary Cottonwood kids to give Cottonwood a chance
- Re-Zone kids South of 45th to Cottonwood.

1.2. French at Driggs, all reasons above and it also would comfort Morningside’s French to be with Morningside’s Traditional.
- French school at Morningside is under a lot of heat, if you decide not to proceed with a French school this could be an option…
- ALC at Upland, this helps their numbers and ALC students tend to feed into Wasatch Jr! Also could Sped and ALC needs somehow complement each-other?
- Strong Traditional presence to make sure French thrives, if students don’t continue to pursue still belong to a school with that option.
- Limits space and help newly boundary Cottonwood kids to give Cottonwood a chance
- Re-Zone kids South of 45th to Cottonwood.

2. Re-Zone kids South of 45th to Cottonwood

3. Guarantees to small schools to help support, if PACs proposal proceeds as is what guarantees are there to make sure our school succeeds based off of your recommendations that does not fix the small schools? Grants for teachers with large class sizes etc?

4. ALC at Cottonwood… It is an option and could be something to look into more. Thank you for hearing the concerns of Morningside ALC and pivoting from the initial PAC recommendation.

Thank you so much for all of your hard work. Unfortunately these are hard decisions and you are at the front of it. Please keep on going, a lot of time and effort has been put into this and teachers and students need results. I all of your work on this and hearing out input!

Thanks,

  Eastwood offers a convenient location that is right off of I 215 and close to I 80, that allows for better access to pick up and drop off.
 Eastwood could easily host the ALC program with minimal disruption to its current students.
Some of the benefits include:

	•	Raises Eastwood enrollment to ≈446 students, improving utilization.
	•	Preserves a top-ranked, GOLD STEM-designated school within Granite.
	•	Minimizes teacher loss and disruption to both Morningside and Eastwood.
	•	Keeps programs in safe, accessible locations—no unsafe walking routes or new bussing burdens.
	•	Allows current buses (e.g., Morningside and Emigration Canyon) to operate more efficiently.
	•	Strengthens GSD’s ability to compete with charter/private schools.
	•	Maintains neighborhood school stability

Other adjustments that I think would be good to make are: 

Adjust Traditional Student Boundaries.
	•	Northern Morningside (north of 3300 S): Re-zone to Eastwood—adds 21–46 students, improves resource use, keeps feeders intact, no extra bussing.
	•	Southern Morningside (around 4500 S): Re-zone north of 4500 to Upland Terrace; south of 4500 to Cottonwood, Driggs, or Oakridge depending on district goals.
	•	Penn Boundary: Shift 84 students closer to Rosecrest to relieve crowding at Penn and allow DLI program expansion.

OR boundary change to move Oakridge students to Morningside and Eastwood.

Optimize DLI Placement and Consolidation.
Place DLI in more strategic location:
	•	French DLI → Oakridge or Cottonwood (depending on capacity).
	•	ALC → Eastwood, leveraging its STEM programs and accessibility.
This plan would offer benefits such as: 
	•	Reduces one principal/building overhead.
	•	Improves utilization at both Oakridge and Eastwood.
	•	Maintains continuity for students and families.
	•	Avoids unnecessary risk and long commute times

 I have submitted this feedback to the feedback doc as well, but wanted to make sure you all received it as well. 
Busing Concerns:
District officials have repeatedly asserted, in public meetings and to the media: that bus times for Emigration Canyon students will be reduced under proposed plans of a Emigration Canyon only route. This assertion is demonstrably false. Even excluding the Millcreek/Cove student pickups (which introduces separate logistical concerns), the proposed canyon route to Oakridge time would not be reduced as outlined below. 


A simulated Emigration bus route (in a car) was performed on current Emigration stops: 2133 N Pinecrest Canyon Rd, 680 N. Emigration Canyon Rd, 6676 E Emigration Canyon Rd, Last Monument Cir & Pioneer Rd (625 N), 672 N Pioneer Fork Rd, 5220 E Pioneer Fork Rd, 5025 E Emigration Canyon Rd (Firestation), 4815 E Emigration Canyon Rd, 4371 E Emigration Canyon Rd, 4072 E Emigration Canyon Rd. (see attached bus stops list given to us by Cirbie at the beginning of this school year) 


This car simulation was conducted at 12pm on an average weather day on October 8, 2025. In the simulation, the car stopped at each Emigration stop for 30 seconds to simulate allowing kids to get on and get back into traffic. Total time in simulation was 51 minutes with just Emigration stops then to Oakridge via Wasatch Blvd up to Oakview. The current route takes 53 minutes, as provided in the times given by our bus driver at the beginning of the school year. This simulation showed that having a route of just Emigration students will not reduce the daily commute and will be basically the same as the current route at Eastwood, including its Millcreek stops. This does not take into account how much time would be added for morning traffic, winter road conditions, or other variables.  It also does not take into account that the district’s plan to have the bus stop only at Emigration Canyon stops is not feasible as set forth below:


The proposal to have a designated bus for Emigration Canyon students only does not work. Granite would need two buses at $220k each, just for the Millcreek/Cove pickups as bus capacity plays a bigger role than they would like to admit. There are 136 students in the Eastwood boundary that would be bussed. That number is not inclusive of the Emigration Canyon students. The bus capacity for elementary students is 84. To safely bus all of the Millcreek/Cove students, plus the 33 Emigration kids. This number also does NOT include the high school and junior high students that are on the bus after school on Monday through Thursday with the elementary school students. 


The Skyline/Churchill route services approximately 18-20 high school and junior high students Monday through Thursday afternoons on the elementary school bus. The recommended plan does not take into consideration that because there is only one bus for all of Emigration Canyon kids, a longer bus ride for elementary school kids would require the bus to start earlier for Jr High and High School students. It currently begins picking up junior high kids at 6:10 a.m. and has just enough time to drop them off and drive back up the Canyon to pick up elementary school children. If any time is added to the elementary bus route, the junior high and high school kids would have to be picked up before 6 a.m. and be at school an hour before it opens. They still would not arrive home until after 4 p.m., meaning that they would spend 10+ hours away from their family for a 6.5 hour school day.

I am submitting my comments encouraging the GSD School Board Members to approve the Alternative Configuration Proposal – Strengthening East Bench Schools that keeps Eastwood Elementary open and takes a more safe and balanced approach to relocating specialty programs with smart boundary shifts in order to better support ALL affected schools and families. It also keeps a top ranked elementary school open over lower-performing schools and preserves the Gold STEM status that Eastwood spend years earning (a status that the school district will lose if the school is closed).

Decisions about school closures are never easy and this school board is bearing the brunt of many difficult evaluations. However, the current recommendations of the PAC simply are not well thought out or a good plan in general for the future educational growth and health of the schools impacted by these recommendations. 

I recently attended the feedback meeting at Eastwood Elementary. Mr. Hogan came woefully unprepared to answer even the most basic of questions and his responses to a very well prepared and thought-out alternative proposal presented by the parent representatives of Eastwood were disrespectful and dismissive at best. I am appalled that the lack of professionalism displayed by Mr. Hogan in regard to a process that deeply impacts hundreds of children has been accepted by this school board. It angers me that school district funds are paying him for work that he clearly is not taking seriously. A group of parents - in their ""spare"" time - ran circles around Mr. Hogan and the PAC recommendations that evening.

You should know that my family's experience at the Eastwood community feedback meeting has propelled us to begin evaluating other educational opportunities for our children - all of which are outside of Granite School District. My family is not alone in this endeavor. We are having conversations regularly with many other parents who are doing the same. It is also very likely that the school district will lose the property tax revenue from ALL households (not just those with kids attending school) from Emigration Canyon - another serious blow to the financial health of the school district.

Closing Eastwood Elementary School does not make sense. The hoops all affected schools will have to jump through with the current PAC proposal do not make sense. The negative impacts on students affected by the current PAC proposal do not make sense. The unnecessary costs, exodus of students, and loss in property tax revenue should this be the vote of the school board is not in the best interest of our children, our neighborhoods, or our school district as a whole.

Again, I urge you to support the Alternative Configuration Proposal – Strengthening East Bench Schools and vote to make this the plan we follow to meet our future educational goals and needs for the schools affected by the PAC recommendations."

This alternative proposal would further strengthen the two highest-performing schools in the area (Eastwood and Oakridge), avoid further transportation strain for Emigration families, ensure longevity of the DLI program, make the ALC program more attractive for families of qualifying kids, and support keeping kids in the Churchill network.

Start Spanish DLI at Oakridge to increase enrollment there. We know Spanish is a big draw already, and easier to get teachers than French. This will bring far more kids to Oakridge than closing Eastwood will."

Eastwood El,Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"Eastwood is centrally located by the freeway, for working parents (which many are with the cost of housing in this area). The easy freeway access makes the difference of my child staying in the district. Oakwood is a massive back track, and difficult to navigate on snowy days.  

My child is very interested in math and science, so that is why we selected Eastwood for him. None of the surrounding schools have this focus. There have been no guarantees from the district that these gifted teachers or STEM teachers will go to Oakridge, which is why we are exploring other options for our child. I will also note that with AI, STEM is more important than ever as it is one of the safest professions. 

I am strongly in favor of keeping Eastwood’s  STEM program in place and instead strengthening the school by moving the ALC program to Eastwood. For parents with multiple kids in elementary (like will have in 2.5 years), this is a huge draw to have two programs with different focuses in one place.

Please study more data before making a final decision. This feels rushed and political. "

Morningside El,Skyline,Morningside Closure,"Although Morningside is not our boundary school, we chose to enroll our daughter there because of the opportunities it offers and the diversity it fosters—factors that were not present at our neighborhood school. Our experience at Morningside has been overwhelmingly positive, and I know many families feel the same.
I respectfully urge the board to consider that school closures should not be based solely on boundary population. In today’s educational landscape, families often seek out schools that align with their values and their children’s needs, regardless of geographic boundaries. Closing Morningside would not simply redirect students back to their neighborhood schools. Instead, many families—ours included—would be forced to look outside the district entirely, turning to charter or private schools in search of the quality and inclusivity that drew us to Morningside in the first place. Morningside is currently operating at 87% capacity, making it the second fullest school in the district. It is difficult to understand why such a well-utilized and thriving school is even being considered for closure. Forcing nearly 600 students to relocate would cause significant disruption to families and the broader community.
Furthermore, the rationale behind not considering lower-capacity schools for closure is unclear. Closing a school with a significantly lower enrollment would have far less impact on students and families and would help balance class sizes across the district more effectively. At Morningside, only 1st and 2nd grades are facing capacity challenges; other grades are running at full or near-full levels. Additionally, Morningside serves as a central and well-equipped site for the ALC program on the east side and is already effectively integrated with the DLI program. Displacing these programs would not only inconvenience families but also dismantle systems that are currently working well. 
I respectfully ask you to reconsider the metrics and priorities guiding this decision. Preserving Morningside is not just about numbers—it’s about honoring what’s working, minimizing harm to students and families, and keeping quality public education accessible to all."

Please consider the work and feedback from the community within PAC 5 and the impact of closing a school that steadily outperforms surrounding schools.

I am the parent of a 2nd grader at Morningside (currently in ALC), and we live in the Morningside boundary, 2 blocks from the school. We chose to move to this neighborhood for the access to the schools, including Morningside, and are very upset about the recommendation to close it. Morningside is a thriving school with over 500 kids and 87% enrollment -- near ideal enrollment, based on the District's standards. It makes no sense to me why a PAC study on declining enrollment/under-enrollment would reach the decision that a school with near ideal enrollment should be closed or transitioned to ~40% enrollment by making it a standalone DLI school. Our daughter is happy and thriving at Morningside. When she joined as a kindergartener, we didn't know if she would test into the ALC program or not -- but being at a school where she had the option for ALC, French or a traditional program was a huge plus to us. Our son will be in kindergarten next year -- hopefully at Morningside -- and we see it as a huge asset that at Morningside he will have options for a program that suits him, whether or not he tests into ALC like his sister. The three programs at Morningside, all under one roof, is a huge asset. It makes no sense for the PAC to view them as individual modules to be chopped up and distributed to other schools to solve those school's problems. It's unfair - unfair to the kids at Morningside who are thriving there and whose school does not have problems and does not need a change, and unfair to the families with kids in multiple programs that would be split up in such a decision. Morningside is a thriving, well-enrolled school, and should be allowed to continue running as the successful school it is.

I am also aware that, since the initial recommendation, the PAC has signaled that the ALC program will not move to Woodstock, but to another Area 5 school, and also signaled that the ALC program should be studied further. Why would you move a program, and then study it? The uncertainty around the ALC program is a further reason the School Board should choose to leave Morningside as it is and carry out an appropriate study of the ALC program before making any changes to it.

I understand the need for a population study in Area 5, with many schools facing under-enrollment. Morningside is not facing this challenge. Morningside is thriving, and should be left alone. I strongly urge the School Board to reject the PAC's recommendation to close Morningside, or any recommendation that involves dividing up its programs and its students. Morningside is an amazing school, in a safe neighborhood location -- my daughter is thriving there, and I hope both of my children are able to continue to be a part of it."

We don’t need more high-rise apartments or property development. We need a school that serves local families, provides safe green space, and keeps our community connected.

- Allow the current French  DLI students to phase over to Eastwood ( start upcoming 1st grade program at Eastwood- that way current Morningside families are not completely disrupted-they have an informed choice going forward as to where their kids are going and families aren’t torn apart)
- make Oakridge the new IB school (it will draw from out of district and grow over the next years)
- keep Morningside as a traditional and alc magnet school and potentially expand it- ( taking the French DLI classrooms one grade level at a time as they slowly move over to Eastwood-this will draw from other districts) or move Woodstock alc ( one grade at a time starting in 1st grade) to Morningside and have two alc sections at Morningside - then they all feed to Wasatch. 

This could make everyone happy and really use our alc program, IB, and French to attract students. No one would hate this, and perhaps in a year, enrollment numbers would be looking better. To me it’s worth a shot before you dismantle these incredible schools. Let’s grow them, not shut them down."

1. If the ALC program truly has to leave Morningside, we're okay with any other nearby school. But throughout this entire process, I haven't heard anyone from the District articulate a defensible reason why the ALC program can't remain at Morningside. The program is well-established and meeting the needs of these kids very well. So it seems like the District is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, and creating a massive set of new problems by moving it. This leads to my next point...

2. Wherever the ALC program is, it needs to remain intact, with as many of the same teachers and administrators and support staff as possible. ALC kids are in the program because they have educational needs that are more complex than typically developing kids--it will not work to just move the kids without also moving the structures and supports that are currently in place that have evolved to meet their complex needs. Our gifted child with a 504 plan has been at three schools in three years and finally found a place to thrive educationally and emotionally with the integrated support of the social worker and the very experienced ALC teacher at Morningside. 

3. Wherever the ALC program is, I hope it can continue to have a late start time (currently 9am). Like many of her peers, our child has developmental and medical issues that make it more challenging than for a typical child to get up in the morning, get ready, and get out the door.

10/13/2025 13:09:00,,,,"Morningside Closure, Other","This feedback was sent to the boundaries email Thur, Oct 9 4:46 PM
""Dear Board Members and PAC Representatives,

Thank you for taking the time to value and listen to community support during this PAC study. I recognize this process is complicated and emotional, with many factors to weigh. I’ve reviewed the recent PAC recommendations and would like to request clarification and supporting data to better understand the reasoning behind several key points.

1. Purpose of the PAC Study
Could the district please clarify the true purpose of this PAC study? Are there additional underlying issues—fiscal, facility, or otherwise—that the community may not be aware of?

My understanding was that the goal is to create larger, more robust school populations. If that is correct, I’m struggling to understand why Morningside Elementary is under consideration for closure when it currently sits near the district’s ideal size at 568 students. Morningside’s enrollment is larger than any other school under review, with only William Penn exceeding that number. I respectfully ask for the data-based justification for this recommendation.

2. Class Sizes and Teacher FTE
How does closing a school lead to smaller class sizes? The district’s FTE allocation ratio of 27.25 students per teacherremains constant regardless of which building those students attend. I request specific data showing how consolidating schools would actually reduce class sizes or improve student outcomes.

As both a former Granite teacher and long-time volunteer, I have seen that larger schools often experience the same class-size issues as smaller ones. The idea of a “perfect” distribution of students by grade level rarely exists in practice.

3. Teacher Workload and Community Support
I understand the district’s concern that small schools may pose additional challenges for teachers, including more duties and fewer in-building collaborators. I empathize deeply with this; teachers are overworked and underpaid. However, based on my own experience, a larger student body does not guarantee relief from these challenges.

While teaching on the west side, I worked at a school with three classes per grade and a healthy population—but no PTA, no art, PE, or music teachers, and no aides. Volunteers were scarce, and I even relied on my mother for classroom help.

In contrast, our east-side communities are full of parents willing to serve, but their help is rarely directed where it truly lightens the teacher workload. Please do not interpret volunteer shortages as a lack of community support; rather, we need better communication about how to contribute meaningfully.

If the district’s goal is to reduce teacher burdens, I ask you to address the FTE ratio itself—27.25 students per teacher—and provide data proving that consolidation improves teacher support or outcomes.

4. Funding and the Local Tax Base
Could you share data showing how a declining student population reduces funding per student within the same geographic area?

Local property taxes contribute approximately 30% of district funding, and these revenues are not based on the number of children per household. As student counts fall, property-tax revenue per pupil should theoretically increase. Given Holladay and Millcreek’s rising property values and business growth, the tax base is expanding even if student numbers are not.

Please provide a breakdown of:

Local property-tax collections and per-student funding over the past five years;

Any equalization adjustments from the state that offset local increases; and

Data showing how a smaller east-side student population results in fewer dollars per child.

5. Measuring Community Support
What metrics are being used to measure community support for proposed closures? Are you tracking the number of comments, responses, and positions (support vs. oppose) by school?

Public schools are not businesses; they are a public service. Their value cannot be measured purely in numbers or efficiency. Our communities succeed because of strong local engagement—neighbors, friends, and families who support children long after the school day ends. Every time a neighborhood school closes, that social fabric weakens.

I urge you to release the quantitative data on community feedback to ensure the process reflects genuine local voices, not assumptions about what communities prefer.

6. Skyline and Olympus Feeder Patterns
Why is the district proposing to close two Skyline feeder schools while redistributing students to Olympus feeders, when Skyline already has fewer students than Olympus?

The district has invested millions to rebuild Skyline High School—a major community resource—and that project is not yet complete. Redirecting students away from its feeder system risks undermining both Churchill Junior High and Skyline’s future enrollment.

Please share the enrollment projections and feeder-flow models showing how these changes support the long-term viability of both Churchill and Skyline.

7. Population-Decline Data
The district has cited an ongoing east-side population decline. I would like to review the data supporting this claim, including the metrics and geographic boundaries used.

Is the decline measured districtwide, by high school feeder system, or by smaller neighborhood zones? In my area, I’ve observed an increase in young families over the past decade. If the data shows otherwise, I would like to understand the factors behind that discrepancy—birth rates, housing trends, or school-choice transfers.

Conclusion
I deeply appreciate the work the district does with limited resources. Granite’s teachers and administrators accomplish remarkable things despite Utah’s chronic underfunding. But decisions of this magnitude must rest on transparent, data-driven evidence, not assumptions.

I respectfully request that the district provide the datasets, forecasts, and justifications discussed above before moving forward with any closures. Once we see the data, I believe our community will fully support whatever solution best serves our children.

Thank you for your time and dedication to our students and neighborhoods.

Sincerely,

""As a parent of 2 Eastwood Alumnae, a grandparent of a recent Eastwood graduate, and a grandchild who would be a  future student I would like to add my two cents (sense) to the conversation.  You have already heard about the transport issue.  I would like to add a few more thoughts.

Currently our neighborhood is full of aging seniors who soon will no longer be in their homes. Many of these homes will be occupied with their own returning children and their kids who could potentially  increase the student population. The East Bench is a prime residential neighborhood and there will be an influx of young families with children.

As parents we evaluated private, charter and public schools and soon realized we had the best school right under our noses.   Eastwood, as we discovered, is a coveted, highly regarded school with some of the best teachers in the state.  How fortunate we were to have this gem.

As working parents, on the occasion when our kids missed the bus, drop off at school in the morning was so easy with the convenience of highway access right there. That was a huge plus and a time saver.

There are many ways to increase enrollment.
Move the gifted and talented program from Morningside to Eastwood. Bring back the Co op parent involved program. It gives parents/ students from other neighborhoods more options and would add to the enrollment.   Our kids thrived with that program forming lasting friendships as well as producing students with the highest grades.
With your proposed plan Oakridge will become overloaded  with Morningside and Eastwood students. Future Housing sales  turnover in the Mt Olympus and Olympus Cove will bring in more students and then adjustments will need to be made again. Instead of thinking downsized neighborhoods think of relocations that will indeed take place on the East Bench.

 Many families that live in our neighborhood who could afford private school education still choose to send their children to Eastwood for many reasons. Quality of teachers, Excellent grades, community support, caring environment.  Many would likely pay to keep the school open.

I do have an in depth understanding of business budgets, but I also understand quality. Closing one of Granite School District’s  best schools is not in the best interest of the students or the School District.

Thank you for the opportunity to reach out.

""Subject: Updated Eastwood Community Study Report: Submitted for Board Review and Consideration

Dear Board Members, Members of the Population Analysis Committee and District Officials, 

I want to thank you for the continued time and attention you have dedicated throughout this process, and for the thoughtful comments and questions shared over the past month. We also sincerely appreciate the Board Members  engagement during the October 7th Board Meeting. In particular, we are grateful to the Board Members for all expressing an interest in exploring alternative options, and to the Population Analysis Committee for formally considering our community’s alternative proposals.

On behalf of the SOS (Save Our School) Eastwood Advocacy Group, I am pleased to share the updated Eastwood Community Study Report of which myself and our core members have updated, following the October 7th board meeting. This updated report ensures the information presented is as current, accurate and data-driven as possible.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, measurable, and intentional data set for your consideration: one that reflects the collective work of Eastwood families and community members since the September 2nd recommendation. 

We have made several important updates throughout this version. Notably, Section XIV – Better Alternatives to Closure has been significantly updated to include data-driven and viable options that effectively address capacity, fiscal, and academic considerations, while preserving safety and community cohesion.
We are very appreciative of the opportunity to share this work for your review. Our intent is to support a well-informed decision-making process grounded in transparent data, consistent methodology, and practical solutions that reflect the best interests of students and families districtwide.

Thank you again for your continued time, leadership, and commitment to due diligence in this important matter. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if further clarification or supporting documentation would be helpful.

Warm regards,

I am writing in support of this plan.

I have 5 children and have had my kids at both Driggs Elementary and Cottonwood Elementary. I LOVE both schools and although my younger kids are now at Cottonwood, I have a strong desire for both schools to thrive after this upcoming change. I would send my kids to either school in a heartbeat. 

My concern with the current proposal is that it will not benefit either school. Currently, the proposal will give Cottonwood 2.5 teachers per grade and Driggs 3.5 teachers per grade. This will likely end up with large class sizes or grade splits for BOTH schools. It would end up being unfair to both of the schools that I love. 

I believe that it would be better to adjust the boundaries to zone more students (ie all Driggs students south of 4500 South) to Cottonwood Elementary to help avoid this problem. I know it was initially hard for me to switch from Driggs to Cottonwood when I first moved my family (we moved into a different home), but I have loved being at Cottonwood just like I loved being at Driggs. I believe the families that switch schools would feel just like I did after the initial adjustment period. 

I know the Cottonwood community well, and I know that they would welcome any and all new families to our community and school. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Eastwood El,Skyline,"The ALC Program, The DLI Program, A Boundary Change, Eastwood Closure, Morningside Closure","I want to thank you for the continued time and attention you have dedicated throughout this process, and for the thoughtful comments and questions shared over the past month. We also sincerely appreciate the Board Members  engagement during the October 7th Board Meeting. In particular, we are grateful to the Board Members for all expressing an interest in exploring alternative options, and to the Population Analysis Committee for formally considering our community’s alternative proposals.

Combine Morningside ALC + Eastwood:  
Move the Advanced Learning Center (ALC, gifted program) from Morningside to Eastwood. Eastwood’s central-east location (just off I-80/Wasatch) is more accessible to families from across the east bench who might attend an accelerated program. Eastwood could host the ALC (which draws ~100 students) with minimal disruption: those students would benefit from Eastwood’s STEM labs and high-performing culture. This would immediately raise Eastwood’s enrollment and utilization, securing its viability. = 446+ students. 
Benefits: 
High utilization score
High performing schools
Keep GOLD STEM
Minimal loss of teachers from either school
Maximizes the competitive advantages of GSD to effectively compete with charter and private schools and attract out-of-district students
No unsafe routes
No increased bussing and the hazards and costs associated therewith.  The bus that is currently bussing kids to Morningside could also be used to alleviate the lengthier bus route caused by only 1 bus (for all kids) in Emigration Canyon.  That bus could do the elementary route for both neighborhoods.

Change in feeder: North Morningside currently feeds to Wasatch. Part 1 of this proposal eliminates the split feeder at Morningside.
PART II: Traditional Student Boundaries
For the northern portion of the current Morningside Boundary (already bussing, N. 3300 S.), re-draw boundaries to add to Eastwood (already bussing).
Benefits:
Adds students to Eastwood (21-46) traditional classrooms for improved teacher resources.
There is no split feeder at Rosecrest. Split feeders hurt the emotional well-being of the ~5 kids from each grade that will be forced to go to a different junior high than all of their friends.
 No additional bussing.
For the southern portion of the current Morningside Boundary, re-draw boundaries to add the northern part (North of 4500) to Upland Terrace and the southern part (South of 4500 S) to Cottonwood, Driggs, or Oakridge.
 Benefits:
Adds students to Upland Terrace for improved teacher resources.
 Cottonwood, helps for improved teacher resources at that school and leaves the Driggs boundary alone.  This section is already a bussing area (because it crosses 4500 S) so it could either walk or continue bussing.
Allows for additional capacity at Cottonwood if the Board chooses Cottonwood as its location for DLI.  (See below). This section is already a bussing area (because it crosses 4500 S) so it could either walk or continue bussing.
If Oakridge, helps for improved teacher resources at that school. This section is already a bussing area (because it crosses 4500 S) so it could continue bussing. There is also a walking path over the freeway that would allow students to walk if it were properly cleared of snow and maintained

Re-boundary Penn to move 84 students who are closer to Rosecrest to Rosecrest to alleviate crowding at Penn, improve Rosecrest utilization and teacher resource scores, and give some room for Penn’s DLI program to grow (it currently turns away students).   

PART III: Cottonwood, Oakridge, DLI
Merge DLI with Cottonwood or with Oakridge at whichever building best fits the district’s goals; merge Cottonwood and Oakridge and leave DLI at Morningside; or merge Oakridge and Morningside Traditional class at Morningside and move DLI.   	
Considerations for DLI + Cottonwood at Cottonwood:
Helps increase Cottonwood’s utilization rate.
Puts DLI near district boundary in a great area to capture the students leaving Butler Elementary’s French program when it closes and draw in students from out-of-district.
Potential capacity issues if trying to stay at Cottonwood campus and not sufficient attrition.
DLI will not be a standalone program school, which typically causes programs to fail and which the district has said it wants to avoid.
As a program, DLI is already supposed to be a commuter program so it minimizes the risk of unsafe walking routes or increased hazardous bus routes.
   Considerations for DLI + Oakridge at Oakridge:
Most in line with PAC recommendation.
Helps increase utilization rate of whichever building is used.
As a program, DLI is already supposed to be a commuter program so it minimizes the risk of unsafe walking routes or increased hazardous bus routes if DLI moves to Oakridge.
Potential traffic issues due to weather conditions and steep streets near Oakridge.
Oakridge has high student and teacher attrition. The Board should study the root cause of those numbers.
Oakridge has a lower FCI score than Morningside.
Potential capacity issues.
 Considerations for either Cottonwood or Oakridge to merge at either building and leave DLI at Morningside.
This and the prior option are most in line with PAC recommendation.
Morningside has a better FCI score.
Would require additional bussing from Cottonwood or Oakridge.
Does not make sense to displace Morningside traditional students and replace them with Oakridge traditional students. Consider keeping some Morningside traditional students at Morningside.   
Considerations for merging Oakridge with Morningside traditional classes at Morningside.  DLI goes to Cottonwood.
Oakridge has the lowest FCI score.
Oakridge students can catch the bus from Churchill to Morningside.
There is a protected walk over I-215 where students can also walk safely to Morningside.
Keeps Morningside traditional kids together. 
Improves utilization score and teacher resources.
Keeps good testing scores.
Better options for pickup and drop off.
MS has low attrition and teacher turnover scores. 
Helps increase Cottonwood’s utilization rate.
Puts DLI near the boundary in a great area to capture the students leaving Butler Elementary’s French program when it closes.
Potential capacity issues if trying to stay at Cottonwood campus.
DLI will not be a standalone program school, which typically causes programs to fail and which the district has said it wants to avoid.
As a program, DLI is already supposed to be a commuter program so it minimizes the risk of unsafe walking routes or increased hazardous bus route.
Another alternative short of closure is to redraw boundaries to balance enrollment among Area 5 schools. Eastwood’s boundary could be modestly expanded to pick up parts of, say, the Upland Terrace or Forest Hills areas (which are currently bused farther to schools like Driggs). 
Eastwood is such a high-performing school, giving more families the chance to attend it would be a positive. 
Adjusting Oakridge’s boundary (which currently extends far north) could send a portion of students who live closer to Eastwood back to Eastwood’s boundary. 
The PAC did some hypothetical boundary redraws on May 14 but unfortunately every scenario they drew still closed Eastwood; they didn’t try one with Eastwood open and Oakridge boundary adjusted. 
Magnet 
If the worry is that Eastwood’s neighborhood alone might not fill the school in the future, Granite could leverage Eastwood’s Gold STEM reputation by placing a district magnet program at Eastwood. 
For example, a STEAM magnet or a “school of science” open to enrollment from across Granite (especially the east bench) could attract dozens of additional students. 
Parents already drive out-of-boundary to Eastwood for its STEM focus; formalizing that as a magnet could expand its draw. Granite has done this with academies (e.g., performing arts at Cyprus) at secondary levels: why not an elementary STEM academy at Eastwood, given it’s the only Gold STEM school on the east side? 
This would further brand Granite as supportive of innovation (rather than eliminating the one innovative school). It also aligns with industry trends of pushing STEM education. 
Rather than losing the Gold STEM designation, Granite could expand its impact by encouraging more students to opt in. 
The Board could direct staff to explore grant funding or partnerships (with the STEM Action Center or local tech companies) to bolster such a magnet. Eastwood’s existing labs and gardens provide a foundation. 
In short, invest in Eastwood as a center of excellence that attracts enrollment, instead of seeing it as excess capacity. This turns a challenge (under-utilization) into an opportunity (magnet seats to fill).

PART VII: Merge Oakridge and Morningside
Oakridge and Morningside have a 100% safe path between the two schools with zero intersections due to A) the designated walking bridge over the freeway + wasatch connecting the two residential zones and B) 100% sidewalk coverage between the two schools. Junior high students already leverage the walking path. A merge in either direction would yield safe walking routes for presumably all students involved. Students can currently walk between the two schools in 15 minutes (if you’re going downhill) and 20 minutes, uphill.

Potentially viable execution paths might include:
Send Oakridge to morningside and ALC to Eastwood.
Send most of Morningside traditional to Oakridge, and keep DLI at Morningside.

PART VIII: Champion Split Grade Classroom Curriculum Innovation
Aside from split overhead responsibilities in small schools, the only reason why teachers struggle with the split grade classroom issue is the lack of dedicated curriculum, training / certification, or other support to teach split grades classes. If an innovative solution could be created in this regard, by our Granite School District, then teachers could better handle the reality that substantially all of our schools experience and will experience for at least the next decade. This solution could be a revolutionary advancement for the collective community, let alone a competitive advantage, leveraging novel technologies to address current prevailing enrollment issues. It may not remove the need for school closures entirely, but it could at least provide potentially substantial relief in an area that so desperately needs it. This solution deserves at least a A) feasibility and B) potential impact assessment. 
The alternatives above (and possibly others we haven’t thought of) demonstrate that Granite can achieve cost-efficiency and adapt to enrollment shifts without tearing apart a successful school community. "
10/13/2025 14:02:24,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,4. Eastwood El,Skyline,Eastwood Closure,"The proposal to have a designated bus for Emigration Canyon students only does not work. Granite would need two buses at $220K each, just for the Millcreek/Cove pickups, as bus capacity plays a bigger role than they would like to admit. 

There are approximately 136 students in the Eastwood neighborhood boundary that would be bussed. That number is not inclusive of the Emigration Canyon students. The bus capacity for elementary students is 84. Safely busing all of the 136 Millcreek/Cove students, plus the 33 Emigration kids, would require three buses. This number also does NOT include the high school and junior high students that are on the bus after school on Monday through Thursday along with the elementary school students. The Skyline/Churchill route services approximately 18-20 high school and junior high students Monday through Thursday afternoons. 

Regarding the need for 3 buses, Dr. Dave Gatti, Transportation Director, told those in attendance at the Nov. 12, 2024 board meeting, when speaking on PAC recommendations and buses: that any suggestions must be bus-neutral because the district building could not park any additional buses. “[J]ust as an FYI we have no more - this is a true statement - No More parking spaces at transportation for buses if we continue to add needs for buses we would probably have to have some sort of a capital project to be able to park them there because we are - we have no empty spaces so we're maxed at that point.” see 11/12 board meeting at 01:29:00-01:30:30.
Moreover, for the last three years, the Emigration families have consistently been informed that no additional bus drivers are available to support expanded service.
Oakridge’s campus was not designed to accommodate regular bus traffic. The district’s own notes, using Oakridge’s small drop-off loop would require buses to “loop around and go backwards into [a] one-way pick-up/drop-off road”, as they are unable to enter the main front drive during peak times. Currently, Oakridge is not designated as a busing school—not even for field trips—according to school officials, parents, and nearby residents. Despite statements from some district representatives, field trip buses are typically observed parking off-campus (either across the street or along the curb) to load and unload students, rather than using the school’s parking lot.
JR High and High School Bus Impact
The recommended plan does not take into consideration that because there is only one bus for all of Emigration Canyon kids, a longer bus ride for elementary school kids would require the bus to start earlier for Jr High and High School students. It currently begins picking up junior high kids at 6:10 a.m. and has just enough time to drop them off and drive back up the Canyon to pick up elementary school children. If any time is added to the elementary bus route, the junior high and high school kids would have to be picked up before 6 a.m. and be at school an hour before it opens. They still would not arrive home until after 4 p.m., meaning that they would spend 10+ hours away from their family for a 6.5 hour school day.  
Conflicting Statements by District Officials
Parents have identified that Granite School District officials, Superintendent Ben Horsley, Planning Director Steve Hogan, Transportation Director Dr. Dave Gatti, and the Communications Office, have issued conflicting and evolving explanations regarding the transportation plan tied to the proposed Eastwood/Oakridge consolidation.
These contradictions, made in public meetings, news interviews, and official correspondence, reveal fundamental inconsistencies in both data interpretation and internal communication within the District.
Superintendent Ben Horsley, in the Sept. 30, 2025 Fox 13 interview, stated that the change would add “an additional two to three minutes on the route from where some of our families are already coming to and from Eastwood now over to Oakridge,” calling it “the least impactful change we could make.” Horsley further asserted that if all Oakridge students were moved to Eastwood instead, the District would “have to double the amount of transportation [we’re] providing.” → These statements portray minimal impact and assume bus availability that other officials later contradicted.
Planning & Boundaries Director Steve Hogan, during the Sept. 22 and 23 Open Houses and the Oct. 7 Board Meeting, repeatedly confirmed that Millcreek Canyon acts as a geographic barrier and acknowledged the unsafe walking routes identified for students north of the canyon, committing instead to “courtesy stops for all students north of Millcreek Canyon.” → While acknowledging safety concerns, Hogan’s assurances imply the District could add routes or stops without increasing bus capacity: an operational impossibility per transportation data.


Transportation Director Dr. Dave Gatti, in contrast, disputed these claims. In his October 9, 2025 email response, he clarified:

“I am not sure which district officials have said the route would be shorter, but it has not been me.”
He further stated that only 39 students north of Millcreek Canyon qualified for transportation and that existing routes could accommodate them without additional buses: a calculation based on average ridership, not full eligibility. Yet, at the Nov. 12, 2024 Board Meeting, he admitted that:
 “We have no more parking spaces at transportation for buses...we’re maxed out at that point.” → These two positions cannot both be true: the District cannot add “courtesy stops” as stated by Hogan or new routes while being “bus-neutral” and at maximum capacity.
The Communications Office, representing the District publicly, told the Salt Lake Tribune (Oct. 8, 2025) that the proposed Emigration Canyon bus route “will actually reduce the current daily commute those students.”
 → This claim was contradicted by parent-led simulations conducted on October 8, 2025, which found the current Eastwood route takes 53 minutes while the proposed Oakridge route takes 51 minutes: a negligible two-minute difference well within normal traffic variation and disproving the assertion of a “reduced” commute. Dr. Gatti himself also disavowed any statement suggesting the route would be shorter,“not sure which district officials have said the route would be shorter, but it has not been me.”
These statements collectively expose serious misalignment between the District’s planning, transportation, and communications departments. The Board and community cannot reasonably rely on a transportation analysis when District leadership cannot agree on its most basic facts:
 (1) the number of buses needed
 (2) the length and duration of proposed routes, and
 (3) Additional courtesy stops for unsafe walk routes to affected students north of Millcreek Canyon.
This breakdown in factual consistency calls into question the credibility of the Population Analysis Committee’s findings and undermines public trust in the District’s decision-making process.
Courtesy Stops and Unsafe Routes
Throughout multiple public meetings: including the Sept. 22 Olympus Open House, the Sept. 23 Skyline Open House, and the Oct. 7 Board Meeting, Planning Director Steve Hogan repeatedly acknowledged that Millcreek Canyon serves as a dividing barrier and acknowledged the lack of safe walking routes for students north of the canyon. In each instance, Hogan stated that the district would therefore need to implement courtesy stops for all students north of Millcreek Canyon to ensure safety and access to transportation.
However, these assurances are contradicted by the district’s own capacity and resource limitations.
Granite’s buses have a maximum capacity of 84 elementary students, while the combined Millcreek/Cove and Emigration Canyon areas represent over 130 eligible elementary riders, plus 18–20 secondary students who share the afternoon route.
This outlines Granite would need 3 total buses for these routes.


At the Nov. 12, 2024 Board Meeting, Transportation Director Dr. Dave Gatti stated plainly that the district’s transportation facilities are at full capacity:

 “We have no more—this is a true statement—no more parking spaces at transportation for buses… we’re maxed out at that point.”
He further emphasized that any additional buses would require a capital project before they could be housed or maintained.
This presents a direct contradiction.
While Hogan publicly affirmed the need for full courtesy busing due to unsafe walking routes, Gatti confirmed that no additional buses or drivers are available to deliver on that commitment.
The result is an unfeasible promise:
The district cannot safely transport all affected students north of Millcreek Canyon without violating its own bus-capacity limits or neglecting Safe Routes standards. This conflict between recognized safety needs and logistical reality underscores a fundamental flaw in the district’s transportation plan.
Inconsistent Claims About Emigration Canyon Commute Times
District leadership has issued multiple and conflicting explanations regarding how the proposed “standalone” bus route from Emigration Canyon to Oakridge would affect student travel times.
At a Sept. 30, 2025 Fox 13 interview, Superintendent Ben Horsley stated that the change “adds an additional two to three minutes on the route from where some of our families are already coming to and from Eastwood now over to Oakridge,” describing it as “the least impactful adjustment we could make.”
This statement was later echoed in the Sept. 22 and 23 Open Houses and Oct. 7 Board Meeting, where Planning Director Steve Hogan claimed that the new configuration would provide “a faster, standalone Emigration Canyon bus route” that would get students “to school quicker than they do now.”
However, Transportation Director Dr. Dave Gatti directly contradicted both assertions. In his October 9, 2025 email, he wrote:
“I am not sure which district officials have said the route would be shorter, but it has not been me.”
Dr. Gatti’s route analysis confirmed that removing Millcreek/Cove stops would save approximately 10 minutes at most, but the difference between the Eastwood and Oakridge exits was “no more than five minutes.”
In reality, a parent-led simulation on October 8, 2025, conducted using the current Emigration bus stops and average driving conditions: found that the current Eastwood route takes 53 minutes, while the proposed Oakridge route takes 51 minutes.This two-minute difference falls well within normal traffic variability and does not account for winter conditions, delays, or shared afternoon ridership with secondary students.
Despite these findings, the District’s Communications Office told the Salt Lake Tribune (Oct. 8, 2025) that the new Emigration Canyon route “will actually reduce the current daily commute of those students.” That statement was demonstrably false and refuted by both the simulation and Dr. Gatti’s own data, showing that there is no meaningful time reduction in the proposed plan.
Breakdown in Interdepartmental Coordination
These conflicting statements underscore a systemic communication failure between Granite School District’s planning, transportation, and administrative leadership.
Planning (Hogan) has acknowledged that Millcreek Canyon poses unsafe walking conditions north of the divide, while simultaneously assuring the public that all affected students will be accommodated through courtesy stops, without addressing the district’s bus capacity, need for more buses, no space for more buses, or driver shortages.


Superintendent’s Office (Horsley) continues to assert that the proposal would shorten commute times and the need to commit to busing for North of Millcreek Canyon students. 
Transportation (Gatti) has repeatedly stated the opposite: implying no need for additional equipment or personnel, confirming that the district is already at maximum bus and parking capacity and could not support new routes without capital expansion.
This misalignment shows that critical elements of the Population Analysis Committee’s transportation model were not collaboratively vetted before being released to the public.
What district officials presented to parents, the media, and the Board were three conflicting versions of the same plan, each undermining the credibility of the others.
Why These Inconsistencies Should Give the Board Pause
The Board is being asked to consider a school closure and boundary change that relies on transportation assumptions which remain inconsistent, unverified, and operationally uncertain.
The following points summarize the practical and procedural concerns these inconsistencies present:
1. Safety Risk & Liability
District officials have acknowledged that Millcreek Canyon represents a dividing barrier and that no safe walking routes exist for students residing north of the canyon. However, the District has not presented a documented or resourced transportation plan that demonstrates how all affected students will be accommodated through busing.
Without a funded plan outlining route logistics, driver allocation, and capacity adjustments, it is unclear how the District intends to meet established student safety and access standards.
2. Data Credibility
The Population Analysis Committee’s transportation analysis shows significant internal discrepancies among statements made by senior officials regarding travel times, bus capacity, and available equipment.
These differences indicate that the underlying data has not undergone a complete cross-departmental verification process. Until a consistent set of assumptions and findings is validated, the transportation component of the closure proposal cannot be considered a reliable basis for decision-making.
3. Policy Compliance
Under Board Policy VII.G.1.D(3)(l), the District must consider “safe walking routes” and “busing and transportation needs” prior to making boundary or closure decisions. These factors were not properly analyzed or documented.
The current record does not demonstrate that these factors were fully analyzed, documented, or incorporated into the Population Analysis Committee’s final recommendations. Proceeding without this compliance review would represent a procedural gap in the decision-making process.

I have two current students at Eastwood through a boundary variance. Our in boundary school should have been Millcreek elementary, but it was closed the year before my oldest began. We were then reallocated to Lincoln elementary and chose to enroll at Eastwood. Eastwood would be the second elementary closure that would directly impact my children in less than 3 years of being enrolled in the Granite district. If Eastwood closes, we are leaning towards moving to a SLC district school or a charter, and will leave the granite school district.  "

** I have concerns about the data and logic being used to make decisions in elementary school studies.

- I can observe is that we have 1/3 of the homes in our immediate 
neighborhood likely to turnover from elderly occupants in the next five 
to ten years.
- It was mentioned at the Millcreek Council Meeting tonight that Millcreek has a larger Senior Citizen population than average.  That will change soon enough.
- Many of the elementary schools were built in the 1960's.  Canyon Rim, 
Millcreek, Spring Lane, Twin Peaks, and what was in Reid School before 
it turned private have all closed since then.
- We may have smaller family sizes, but we've also had infill since the 
1960's and 80's.  Note the Reid school is turning into homes.
Some of that is larger class sizes.  Something we are not a fan of in the Elementary service/product.
- Some of that is larger schools (targets of 500 kids rather than 250-350) 
which we are also not a fan of as we prefer walkable neighborhood 
schools at the elementary level with kids learning to build communities.
- The Millcreek downtown is filling in with density and it's moving eastward 
on 33rd south.  Those kids are going to feed into the schools west of 
Eastwood supporting those schools (Rosecrest) in the long term and some 
will also come to Eastwood (Rosecrest already sends 10 to Eastwood).  
- With Canyon Rim Academy hitting its charter enrollment cap, and its 
reconstruction almost complete, this also lets Eastwood have that 
natural boundary extension westward back without undermining other 
schools.
- I understand the benefits of economies of scale.  As a parent - that's 
not what I want so I look for alternatives to GSD because the Elementary
 service has been undermined.
- The only data available on the GSD webpage about demographics is ""school mobility"" with current students and some historical trend data on enrollment.  Nothing detailed or 
forward looking.  If this was the extent of the study I'm very concerned
 about the validity/voracity.  At the meetings we were told all the data
 was on the webpage.  People keep asking for the data perhaps because we
 are shocked how little forward looking (how many elementary kids in the
 area in 15 years?) and competitive analysis (how many kids are in area 
but going out of boundary) research has been done. Federal Census data which I can research does not have a region delineation that makes for quality research into our area.

**Suppose my assumptions about leveling student demographics is wrong:  We have grave concerns about the reactionary nature of current and past elementary school 
closings and a lack of 40-50 year horizon leadership.

- If the ""enrollment cliff"" trend continues - we are not done closing elementary 
schools and it seems we have a history of closing the wrong schools that
 would benefit the current long-term vision of a lower population 
district (Canyon Rim Elementary).
- The Eastwood property sits on 11 acres.  The most east of I-15.  If you 
have to close it - rebuilt it while it's closed under a new name to be 
the primary elementary school for the NE corner of the District.
- My family in the Eastwood area has more connection to the Canyon Rim 
Community than it does to Olympus Cove.  Lumping the neighborhood north 
of Millcreek in with Olympus Cove/Oakridge Elementary is a common 
misconception of people that don't live here.
- The jerrymandering to Morningside Elementary away from Eastwood of the disconnected area north of 33rd South and West of 215 is at least a mistake and at worst has undermined 
Eastwoods logical enrollment numbers.  It just looks bad and felt like a setup.
- While I don't love the approach of focusing on out of boundary headcount - I 
understand the business side - Eastwood is the best positioned property 
for out of boundary commuters to the UofU, Research Park from all along 
215 and Park City to poach out of boundary headcount.  If the district 
is shrinking - poach some kids to keep the funding that will also feed 
into Skyline.  20% of the kids in 5th Grade at Eastwood are 
from out of the district.  This number would be the same or higher for 
every other grade except for the closure talk that started 2-5 years 
ago.
- Picking a school for my kids is a 6-year commitment for one kid, 8+ years for 
more than one kid.  Rumors of schools closing is very damaging to 
enrollment because I will find another school to start them at.  I 
believe this has undermined Eastwoods draw of out of District kids and 
in area kids. 
- Eastwood's mobility data shows it is the best school for collecting a larger 
area.  33rd South, Wasatch, and 215 just make it naturally so.  Parents 
are already choosing to do just that - if that's where we are headed - 
there is no reason to fight what's already naturally happening.
- The east end should not lose its ALC program option - and it should be put 
at an easy to access property for a broad area.  A hard number ranked 
cap and waitlist should not be set, but rather like Canyons District if 
you hit a threshold you will be allowed in.

**Even with a district created headwind Eastwood has remained relatively 
resilient and I believe with proper analysis, leadership, and 
understanding of the elementary service is among GSD's best Elementary 
assets and has the best long-term potential.

If GSD insists on closing Eastwood, the next best course of action is to plan to rebuild 
on the Eastwood and Morningside properties the elementary schools at 
sizes needed that will serve the East Millcreek and North Holladay areas
 for the next 50 years based on an independent commissioned demographic 
forecast and find ways to do the same for two schools serving the 
Highland drive area - one north and one south and so on for the entire district."

A fair solution is to give both schools 3 teachers per grade by zoning all Driggs students south of 4500 South to Cottonwood.

I also do not support keeping Eastwood open with the ALC program there and the French Program at Oakridge. To meaningfully reduce overcrowding, the PAC should consider closing two or three schools.

""Dear Members of the Population Analysis Committee and Board of Education,

My name is [name removed] and I am a member of the Cottonwood Elementary community.  My family and I are very passionate about Cottonwood Elementary.  It has been such a positive experience for our four girls to attend that school and we attribute our oldest, neurodivergent daughter's success to the support in that learning environment.  

We understand that the Population Analysis Committee is studying a proposal to zone all students living south of 4500 South from Howard R. Driggs Elementary to Cottonwood Elementary and I am writing in support of this plan.
 

The PAC’s current proposal to send 100 Driggs students is inequitable - specifically because it would give Cottonwood Elementary just 2.5 teachers per grade vs. 3.5 teachers per grade for Howard R. Driggs.   In addition, only offering 100 students - where a significant percentage will just special permit back to their current school - will not have a lasting impact on the enrollment at Cottonwood.  

It's easy to see that it does not make sense to do all of the work that has been done - only to give one school a 40% advantage in teacher/grade ratio - especially when there is a very simple opportunity to give both schools 3 teachers per grade and avoid larger class sizes or grade splits.  Dividing equitably will provide students from both schools with a better learning environment. 

In addition,  While Howard R. Driggs is split as a feeder school between Skyline and Olympus, Cottonwood is exclusively a feeder school to Olympus.  By splitting along 4500 South, you are dividing more in line with what the high school boundaries will be.  By striving to keep entire neighborhoods together, it will lead to stronger, more stable enrollment at Cottonwood for both the short-term and longer-term.  This would keep neighborhoods and communities more tied together throughout the elementary, junior high school, and high school enrollment and provide more stability and support for parents and be more attractive for new families looking to move in.  

Please adjust the boundaries more equitably by zoning all Driggs students south of 4500 South to Cottonwood Elementary.   This will have such a positive outcome for those who reside in the southeastern zone of the Granite School District and will be more sustainable to avoid additional boundary changes in the future.  
 

Thanks for all you do and thank you for listening to our insights!

""Hello Director Hogan and Superintendent Horsely,

I am reaching out to share some information that might be of interest to you should you move forward with the decision to close Eastwood and move its students to Oakridge, and also to continue to advocate for Eastwood to stay open.

I am not sure if you are aware of the City of Millcreek's plans to construct a shared use path on the westside of Wasatch Blvd between 3680 South and 4500 South.  Construction of the project was initially scheduled to begin this summer but is now planned for Spring of 2026. Here is a link to the project overview page*. The northern end of the project would tie into the existing facilities at the Upper District Park and when complete would provide a separated pedestrian and bike facility between approximately 3600 South and 4500 South. Although students would need to cross Wasatch Blvd in order to access the facility, there is an existing crosswalk at 3600 South, a signalized intersection at 3800 South and what appears to be an existing designated school crossing on Wasatch Blvd near Oakview Dr.  It seems possible that the District could work with Millcreek to explore the potential of UDOT adding to and improving the safety of school crossings along Wasatch.  I appreciate that the District is proposing to provide elective bus service to the majority of students outside of the mandated busing area and I mention this only as an additional consideration to help address the safe walking route concerns that have been raised.

Switching over to advocating for keeping Eastwood open, the District has previously pointed to the overall low enrollment at Eastwood and specifically the low utilization by boundary eligible students (25% or 125 students) as a factor in its recommendation to close the school.  While this is important and is concerning in some aspects, it is also very telling that about half of Eastwood students choose to attend from outside the school boundary; Eastwood is already functioning akin to a magnet school. It speaks volumes about the excellence of Eastwood that so many parents would pass-up the convenience of a neighborhood school or bus service to drive their kid(s) to and from school everyday. To me, this is an opportunity for growth and for students, not a disadvantage.

Anecdotally, Eastwood's easy access off of I-215 makes out-of-boundary attendance a possibility where it would otherwise not be for many parents. In our own home, we chose to keep our daughter at Eastwood when she tested into the Morningside ALC program due to a combination of Eastwood's excellence and the barrier Morningside's harder-to-access location and limited busing options created for our two-working parent household. I am curious if the District tracks where the out-of-boundary students are coming from and the performance of students in-boundary schools compared to Eastwood.  I encourage the District to evaluate Eastwood's student population holistically as Eastwood could be providing valuable educational opportunities to students whose in-boundary school may have different resource priorities and challenges. 

Regarding attendance by in-boundary students, I am curious if there has been any study into factors contributing to the low rate of attendance. In anticipation of the potential closure of Eastwood, our family has been exploring other options for our daughter's education. Residing in Emigration Canyon, we are closer to several Salt Lake City School District schools and we are heavily favoring open-enrollment at a SLCSD school. This is not because of any real or perceived increase in the length of the bus ride- we know living in Emigration means it takes longer to get places. However, SLCSD offers affordable after school care programs at many of its schools and this is a very significant consideration in our decision-making. With changing remote work policies, we will need an afterschool program next year. The lack of an in-school option at Oakridge or of a care provider in our vicinity that will pick-up at Oakridge has more or less made the decision for us.  I can't help but wonder how many children would otherwise attend Eastwood but don't because of the limited after school options; I personally know of several. Sending Eastwood students to Oakridge seems likely to worsen the situation.

Lastly, as an aside, I'd like to make a suggestion that the District publish its email communications related to the study process on its website. I am sure you have received multiple GRAMA requests for this information- mine was one of them. From what I gather, the District's general response has been to inform people of the associated costs and ask if they would like to move forward with the request. While this is not unreasonable, I'd like to suggest that proactively sharing this information would be a way to show transparency and combat some of the distrust that is becoming widespread. It is likely that information from the paid requests will be shared between parent groups regardless and it seems to me it would be favorable to get ahead of it. 

Thank you for your time. While I have concerns about the study, associated data and recommendation, I appreciate your professional communication and the opportunities for feedback you've provided over the past several weeks.

10/14/2025 11:59:39,"B) I live within the boundaries of one of the affected schools, but do not have children attending at this time.","4. Eastwood El, 14. Wasatch Jr, 17. Skyline High",Skyline,"The ALC Program, A Boundary Change, Eastwood Closure","Hello. I am writing to affirm the Alternative Configuration Proposal presented by Eastwood Elementary and Morningside ALC parents. Eastwood Elementary is uniquely positioned to bring on the ALC program from Morningside. Many Eastwood students test and qualify for the ALC program. However, most choose to stay at Eastwood instead of moving to Morningside, due to Eastwood's already-strong Advanced Learning Clusters. Some even move to Morningside for the ALC program, but move back to Eastwood because they like it better. There were so many students that qualified for the ALC in last year's 5th grade classes, that an additional 5th grade teacher had to obtain their GT endorsement. Both 5th grade classes had a GT endorsed teacher. In fact, most grades at Eastwood have TWO teachers with GT endorsements. Eastwood already serves a large population of advanced learners and gifted children, like my son was throughout his 6 years of K-5 at Eastwood, plus preschool at there as well.

I took an informal online poll in Eastwood's parent advocacy group of over 100 parents. Some are more active in the online group than others, so not all parents voted in the poll. 12 parents whose children qualified for Morningside ALC, chose to keep their child at Eastwood. 3 parents responded that they went to Morningside from Eastwood for the ALC, but returned to Eastwood after trying Morningside. That's around 15% of parents in the group where not everyone saw or answered the poll question. There are are more parents who are not active online in the group who also chose to keep their ALC-qualified children at Eastwood. Why? Walkable neighborhood, access to GT endorsed teachers and advanced learning clusters, an outstanding learning environment, and the social-emotional experience at Eastwood. 

I would like to bring attention to the fact that GT/ALC students ARE traditional students. They did not choose to have unique academic and social-emotional needs. They did not ask for an optional program such as DLI. They have a right to as much academic growth as the “traditional"" students that have been a focus of discussion at PAC meetings. For example, DLI is a bonus program. ALC/GT is a true need, not an extra or nice-to-have. 

In addition to providing a stronger learning environment for more of area 5 advanced learners and gifted students, these are additional benefits to moving the ALC to Eastwood:

Alternative Program & Boundary Configuration

1. Relocate the Advanced Learning Center (ALC) to Eastwood Elementary.
Eastwood’s central-east location near I-80/Wasatch offers better access for families across the east bench. The school can host the ALC (≈100 students) with minimal disruption, utilizing its existing STEM facilities and high-performing culture.

Benefits:
• Raises Eastwood enrollment to ≈446 students, improving utilization.
• Preserves a top-ranked, GOLD STEM-designated school within Granite.
• Minimizes teacher loss and disruption to both Morningside and Eastwood.
• Keeps programs in safe, accessible locations—no unsafe walking routes or new
bussing burdens.
• Allows current buses (e.g., Morningside and Emigration Canyon) to operate more
efficiently.
• Strengthens GSD’s ability to compete with charter/private schools.
• Maintains neighborhood school stability by giving traditional students five-year
priority to remain with siblings and peers.

2. Adjust Traditional Student Boundaries.
• Northern Morningside (north of 3300 S): Re-zone to Eastwood—adds 21–46
students, improves resource use, keeps feeders intact, no extra bussing.
• Southern Morningside (around 4500 S): Re-zone north of 4500 to Upland
Terrace; south of 4500 to Cottonwood, Driggs, or Oakridge depending on district goals.
• Penn Boundary: Shift 84 students closer to Rosecrest to relieve crowding at
Penn and allow DLI program expansion.
OR boundary change to move Oakridge students to Morningside and Eastwood.
3. Optimize DLI Placement and Consolidation.
Place DLI in more strategic location:
• French DLI → Oakridge or Cottonwood (depending on capacity).
• ALC → Eastwood, leveraging its STEM programs and accessibility.

Additional Benefits:
• Reduces one principal/building overhead.
• Improves utilization at both Oakridge and Eastwood.
• Maintains continuity for students and families.
• Avoids unnecessary risk and long commute times.

Summary:
This alternative achieves consolidation without compromising safety or performance.
It’s a practical, data-driven solution that fulfills Granite’s efficiency goals while protecting
families, teachers, and students.

The Granite School Board and the PAC are in a position to turn the negative experience of closing schools, into a positive reconfiguration that will have an immense positive impact on numerous students and families. Why not reach the same or better goals by reconfiguring schools instead of closing them? In meetings, Superintendent Horsely and Steve Hogan have continually said ""it's not about money, it's about class size"". At the September 30th meeting, we suddenly learned from Steve Hogan, that it was also about feeders, much to parents' and even Superintendent Horsely's surprise, after all this time and discussion without emphasis or barely a mention of feeders. The Alternative Configuration Proposal will have a positive effect on elementary feeders to junior highs and high schools.

I am writing regarding the proposal to add the French Dual Immersion (DLI) program to our school, Oakridge. In discussions with many other parents, I believe our community’s needs would be better served by the expanding access to ALC (Advanced Learning Center) program, which would provide stronger academic opportunities and resources to our student body.

Please do not place the French DLI program at Oakridge. If any new program is added, I urge you to choose the ALC program as the best option for our students and community.

Thank you for your attention and your dedication to our school throughout this process. "
10/14/2025 23:11:25,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,5. Morningside El,Skyline,The ALC Program,"Please involve the ALC community before making decisions that directly affect our program and students. 

A few important points to consider:
	
1. It is not possible to accurately determine the top 5% of students if ALL students are not tested. 5% of an arbitrarily chosen group is arbitrary. 
	
2. Oakridge is closer to the current ALC location than Eastwood and is within the same Churchill Junior High/Skyline High School feeder pattern, unlike Cottonwood. Currently, 24 Morningside boundary students and 17 Oakridge students attend the ALC, compared with only 5 from Eastwood. Oakridge is therefore the most reasonable alternative to Morningside. Pairing the ALC with an IB program that is being considered at Oakridge would create a strong academic environment that benefits all students. The Board’s decision here will have a lasting impact on our junior highs, and it’s important to note that Churchill in particular needs continued support.
	
3. Testing students out of the ALC after 2nd grade—especially based on a single assessment—can be detrimental to children’s confidence and emotional well-being. Students should only be removed in rare cases where the program is clearly not a good fit. A more constructive approach might be to add an additional class at the 3rd-grade level to accommodate students who are identified later in their development, rather than displacing current students. 

While my own children have not been personally affected by these policies, I am concerned about their impact on the broader ALC community and the well-being of all children involved.

Thank you"
10/15/2025 5:43:12,A) I am a parent / patron with students attending one of the schools in the boundary study.,"5. Morningside El, 14. Wasatch Jr, 17. Skyline High",Skyline,"A Boundary Change, Morningside Closure","Thank you to all those from the school district who attended the meeting at Morningside Elem. last night. I greatly appreciate your time and expertise. Superintendent Horsley announced last night that Area 5 elementary schools will be adopting the IB early bright program (my apologies if I didn't get that program name exactly right); what a wonderful opportunity for our students. 
Something that has been overlooked with one of the current closure recommendations is the fact that students in Morningside boundaries are being sent to two schools not in Area 5, thus not participating in the IB program. 
Another concern of mine is having to send my elementary children to two different schools due to the programs they are in. I understand my children would go to wherever the DLI program ends up and Howard R. Driggs Elem. I understand there are two different start times, but that would leave me sending my five children to four school with four different start times. Not only that, I am already juggling volunteering, SEPs, and other school events for three school and throwing in another one just adds to the overwhelming stress of supporting my children and the schools they attend. I know mine is not the only family in (or would be in) this situation.
I'm throwing out an additional recommendation that could help with both of the above concerns: If Morningside where to close, the students in the traditional program in the northern boundary, which feeds into Wasatch Jr., would go to Upland Terrace, which also feeds into Wasatch Jr. Those in the traditional program attending Morningside in the southern boundary, which feeds into Churchill Jr., are assigned to Oakridge, which also feeds into Churchill Jr. High. Oakridge elementary then takes the traditional and French DLI program (Churchill has the French DLI), allowing two or more classes of each grade level for teachers to collaborate and so forth. Families with traditional and DLI students only have one school to attend. There is no perfect solution, as was reiterated last night. I realize that some families have children in all three programs; I have had children in all three programs. Multi-program families just want to keep their students in one place.
I realize that neither of those elementary schools are within walking distance of those neighborhoods, but even the families in my neighborhood who are assigned to Howard R. Driggs Elem and live in walking distance still drive their children. Oakridge is over a mile from my home, whereas Driggs is only two blocks. I would rather keep my family together than have my children within walking distance to two separate schools.
Perhaps an additional recommendation is to do a similar change with the ALC to Upland Terrace or another area 5 school.
Thank you for your time."

We have had no issue regarding winter safety. Drivers are safe all year around. I have no out of normal concern with safety on the campus and walking to campus due to its location or inclement weather. 
Merging Eastwood over to Oakridge is fantastic! Combining the schools will encourage community and culture that includes all of the Olympus cove neighborhood. What a wonderful inclusive plan for families who reside in the cove. 
Please do not bring another program to our traditional school. Our school culture will increase with the addition of Eastwood families. I strongly feel that bringing the ALC program and DLI program will divide culture and create unnecessary conflict and disrupt culture growth. I strongly oppose bringing DLI to Oakridge. I strongly oppose bringing ALC to Oakridge. Maintaining DLI at Morningside is fantastic for those learners that are already there and in the program. Keeping it a one track school is best for all programs. Friends at Morningside describe conflict with the three differing programs in one school. They feel the traditional learners have the least advantage both scholastically and even socially. Keeping that strong and desirable French immersion program as a standalone school, I believe, will only strengthen the program, the culture and social aspects for the students.

I’m horrified by the idea of allowing one child to stay at morningside, while removing the other child from her friends, school and community. Getting removed from ALC at 3rd grade wrecked my child. Now she might lose her school and her friends and her sibling. What am I going to do? I will have to remove her sister from ALC because the thought of dropping one child off for school at morningside and not the other is CRUEL. This breaks my heart. Please don’t do this to my child.

""Hello



My name is [name removed] I am a parent and an employee of granite school district. I currently live in Oakridge boundaries but prior to that lived in Twin Peaks boundaries [info removed] and my children attended Millcreek and Woodstock during the time that the schools in that area were closed. [Identifying information removed]

I have agreed with this process from the start that closing schools needs to happen. I was supportive when Millcreek and twin peaks closed, even as it affected my neighbors and families I worked with. And I was excited and welcomed new students to Woodstock. I thought as a parent, the addition of the extra students was positive and indeed provided more and better resources for the school. I did not see any negative impact on my kids experience and if anything appreciated the additional students and the expansion of the Woodstock community. When my youngest didn’t test to continue in the ALC program at Woodstock (which is a different subject to discuss another time) we decided to move him to Oakridge to be at his neighborhood school and try to meet more of our neighbors as it became clear early on to us moving into the area that there were not many kids to meet without being at the school. While we are only a few months into the school year, the difference between a larger school such as Woodstock and a smaller school such as Oakridge has been stark to me. It has been harder for my son to integrate into such a small school. And it has felt harder for me as a parent as well. We moved him hoping that as the study was currently in progress at least one of the schools in the cove would close and the small school experience would only be temporary. As a parent I am hopeful and excited for the two schools to combine and give more opportunities to my son and our family.

As a teacher, I understand the purpose and fully support the theory of optimizing resources for our students across the district. I have followed this study much like the others, I’ve attended community council meetings at Churchill, larger meetings at skyline and have watched the replays when I could not attend in person.

I’m writing you to say that I hope you follow the PACs recommendation for school closures in area 5. While as a parent I feel I and our community will benefit from the cove having a singular elementary, as a teacher I have stronger feelings that if the board chooses to not close schools on the east side it sends an incredible message of inequity in our district. Many schools that have been closed west were also treasured and successful neighborhood schools. Many had multigenerational families that attended and contributed to the school community. Many also had enrollment much higher than the ones currently in the study. Redwood is one that comes to mind where I sat in many meetings listening to parents talk about how upset they were. Westbrook is another. I am a full believer in equity for all of our children in our district. And I’m a full believer in making sure that our more vulnerable groups of children and families are not ignored or given the same resources as children and families that have more resources to be louder and more organized. If schools in area five are given more “grace” simply because the parents were better at advocating for themselves I will be incredibly disheartened as a public school educator.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email and thank you for all of your hard work during this time, despite the stressful circumstances. I commend you for not only this current study but the prior ones as well. Thank you.

""Mr. Hogan,

I am a parent at Eastwood Elementary and I am requesting additional information about the Facility Condition Index concerning the Area 5 PAC Study. I know that the FCI percentages available on the Granite School Website (https://gsdfuture.org/why-rebuild/facility-conditions/facility-condition-index/) were calculated by a third party, completed in 2017.

However, there are two elements for which I am formally requesting additional information/data:
1. A copy of the study as it pertains to the Area 5 Schools (as it was funded by Granite School District and it was used as a data point for the current PAC Area 5 study, it should be readily available)
2. Additional information about how the Area 5 Schools were given a ""ranking"" as you presented in the initial March 2025 Open Houses. I am requesting hard numbers and calculations about how (even before the PAC began its study for Area 5) the percentages from the 2017 study were converted into rankings for each school in the area.

""Saturday Oct 11: Dear Clarke,

My name is [name removed]; I'm the parent of a 4th grader in the ALC program at Morningside Elementary. I bring 14 years of experience as a former secondary educator, curriculum developer, instructional coach, and literacy coach for content-area teachers. This background has given me expertise in analyzing school data, evaluating program impacts, and guiding decisions that balance student needs with instructional quality.

Several Morningside parents encouraged me to resend this Pause and Reset Proposal directly to you. It is believed you might recognize the need to pause and reset the Area 5 boundary study before further decisions are made.

The current district approach—while well-intentioned—is short-sighted and reactive, more akin to throwing darts at a dartboard and hoping to hit a bullseye than following a deliberate, evidence-based process. Presenting only one “preferred” option to the public does not serve the constituency. When stakeholders are shown a single path forward, it gives the impression that a decision has already been made rather than developed through authentic analysis and engagement.

Equally concerning is the district’s pattern of presenting one proposal and then asking communities to “come up with alternatives” if they disagree. This practice shifts the burden of analysis and solution-design to parents and community members—people without access to the same data or tools—while absolving the district of transparent responsibility. This imbalance deepens frustration and erodes trust.

A credible and inclusive process requires that multiple viable options be developed and tested by the district itself, using consistent, transparent criteria that all stakeholders can review. Only then can the community respond thoughtfully and collaboratively, rather than defensively, to what currently feels like a predetermined outcome.

In response, I’ve developed a sequential framework and rubric (attached) that provides a clear, transparent pathway for decision-making—and most importantly, requires every school in Area 5 to explore the best way forward. The process begins with verified data collection and objective evaluation criteria aligned to district goals: enrollment balance, program access, facility condition, safety, and fiscal efficiency.

Each school is then assessed using a shared rubric, reviewed by multiple stakeholder groups—including building administrators, an elected council of teachers and parents from every school in the study, and a district advisory council. This ensures that recommendations emerge from evidence and collective insight, not assumption or emotion.

Right now, the lack of transparent criteria has left each Area 5 school to define “what’s best” for itself, often based on incomplete information. This has turned what should be a collaborative planning process into one that feels competitive and chaotic, dividing communities instead of uniting them around shared goals for strong, sustainable schools and innovative programs for our kids. Every Area 5 school should be playing offense, not defense—working proactively toward shared success. Unfortunately, the district’s current approach has instead created a huge divide between schools, forcing them to defend their existence rather than collaborate on a collective vision for excellence.

Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration. I’d welcome the opportunity to meet or speak further about how a pause and reset could realign the process with the district’s stated values of equity, transparency, and community trust.

Warm regards,
[name removed]

Thurs, Oct 16: Hi Clarke, 

I get the feeling that the district is NOT going to pause and reset the study. Thus, I’m sharing the attached Area 5 Advanced Learning Cohort (ALC) Pathway Proposal, which outlines a sustainable model that prioritizes both advanced learners and boundary families. (Attachment can be viewed here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F808bHaP7W1S2YTP_rcN8C_X9WJPHadQ/view?usp=sharing) A critical point in this proposal is that ALC must remain paired with a strong, STEM-enriched traditional track—staffed by proven educators and marketed effectively to boundary families. This approach keeps siblings together and ensures programs thrive through inclusive enrollment and high-quality instruction.
Families in our community value having their children in the same school, especially those managing different learning needs and busy schedules. When ALC programs are separated from traditional tracks—or paired only with other magnets—they become less accessible and risk declining participation. Housing both tracks together allows families to stay engaged, supports continuity, and preserves ALC’s purpose: to meet the needs of advanced learners within a diverse, community-based setting.

This proposal builds a cohesive, long-term vision for Area 5 that balances excellence, equity, and family practicality. I hope you’ll review the attached document with this in mind as you consider next steps for the future of ALC and traditional programming across the district.

Warm regards,
[name removed]

""Hi,
I am a parent of four, three of which are currently attending Cottonwood Elementary. My fifth grader has 38 kids in his class this year and while his teacher is fantastic, it’s definitely added stress to make sure none of these cute kiddos are falling through the cracks. She has a full time para but even with that, my fifth grader has told me that it’s hard to manage everyone. Please consider giving cottonwood more students so that we can get more teachers. I have talked with many parents who feel the same and do not want to attend a school with such large class sizes. We need to bring our class sizes back down to 25-28 per class so these kids can thrive. There are some very determined parents in our neighborhood who are really pushing to split the district and this is only fueling that fire. I’d hate to see that happen but it is being discussed by more and more families in our area. Getting 100 kids from the proposed boundary change would give us only a couple teachers but yet add extra kids to already large classes.

""Dear Boundary Study Committee,



I wanted to share some feedback regarding the proposed boundary changes for Cottonwood Elementary. I appreciate the effort that has gone into trying to balance enrollment, but I’m very concerned that the current proposal—dividing neighborhoods and church wards—will have the opposite effect of what’s intended.

Right now, the new boundary lines cut through the middle of established neighborhoods and LDS wards. This creates confusion and hesitation for families, many of whom are already expressing plans to submit permits to stay at their current schools rather than move to Cottonwood. When families see their neighbors and friends staying behind, it makes it far less likely they will choose to transition alone.

Instead of solving the enrollment issue, this approach risks keeping Cottonwood’s numbers low and continuing the current imbalance. I strongly encourage the committee to consider moving entire neighborhoods together into the Cottonwood boundary, specifically the whole area south of 4500 South. That would give the school a larger, more cohesive group of students who are likely to come together and commit to the new school community.

Cottonwood is a wonderful school, but for this plan to succeed, the boundaries need to make sense socially as well as geographically. Families follow their communities—and if we want them to follow new boundaries, we need to keep neighborhoods intact.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I know these are difficult decisions, but I truly believe this change would make the plan more successful for everyone involved.

Sincerely,

I am writing in support of this plan and I also live in this Driggs boundary neighborhood, but we transferred into cottonwood boundaries. I have spoken to many of my Driggs neighbors and have gotten a lot of input. Some of these I would like to highlight is that the current proposal splits our neighborhood between Driggs and Cottonwood, which divides friends and carpools. Families are less likely to switch schools if their neighborhood is split — it makes transitions harder for kids. Also, moving an entire neighborhoods together will lead to stronger, more stable enrollment at Cottonwood. Along with that, keeping neighborhoods intact builds community and helps families feel connected to their new school. Overall, this new boundary change would make the boundary plan more successful and better supported by parents.
